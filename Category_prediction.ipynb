The story is good and actually gets more interesting. Worth the try.\\nLong Review:\\nBlackwell Legacy is the first on the series of (supposedly) 5 games that talks about the main protagonist, Rosangela Blackwell, as being a so called Medium, and in this first chapter we get to know how her story will start and how she will meet her adventure companion Joey...and really, that\\'s really all for for now and that\\'s not a bad thing, because in a way this game wants to show how hard her new job is, and that she cannot escape her destiny as a medium.\\nMy biggest complain for this chapter, except the short length, it\\'s the main protagonist being a \"bit\" too annoying to be likeable, and most of her dialogues will always be about complaining or just be annoyed. Understandable, sure, but lighten\\' up will ya!?\\nHowever, considering that in the next installments she will be much more likeable and kind of interesting, I\\'d say give it a shot and see if you like it: if you hate this first game, you might like the next, or can always stop here.\\nI recommend it.',\n",

Sonic Generations es el titulo de aniversario del erizo POR DEFINICION mezclando todas las zonas caracteristicas y entrañables de los mejores juegos, brindando viejas piezas musicales remasterizadas y remescladas, pero tampoco creas que son los mismos escenarios, PARA NADA, ya que SEGA se saco un truco de la manga: Classic Sonic, el erizo en su diseño de los dias de gloria... No solo el diseño, TODO lo que amabas de la trilogia del Genesis esta en los niveles de esta version del erizo: plataformeo puro, Por el contrario, el Sonic moderno brinda el significado de la velocidad y la intensidad pura. Eno conclusion: Sonic Genrations es un juego que se necesitaba en la crisis, pero nos abre los ojos para darnos cuenta de la decadencia de Sonic, el juego no es malo... pero se aprovecha de los demas juegos perdiendo una escencia unica, dando a entender que podria ser un tiempo oscuro para el erizo debido a que no ha habido una buena direccion para sus juegos',\n",

The map is huge and allows for a ridiculous amount of exploration, in that you're free to check out a bunch of towns that look the same, small cities that look like the small towns or the single buildings in the middle of nowhere that look like the buildings in the small towns. In my time playing this I've only ever seen one other player, even in full servers. Instead of exchanging glares while we calculated whether or not a fight would be worth it, he punched me once then promptly ran away.\\nBottom line, it's fun if you know what you're doing, boring as hell if you don't. If you get the game, read those guides kids. Of course even then it's still a crapshoot.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'If the devs had the mentality of \"lets make everyone who plays this game experience new levels of hatred\" then and only then would they have accomplished their goals. I fully believe that this game will never live up to the dayz mod due to so many issues with collision, awkward as hell spawn locations, absolutely stupid changes each new update, and just overall slow progress, this game is nearly 3 years old and is still not finished, in my mind that alone is reason enough for this game to not be bought, sadly though i made the mistake of purchasing it when it had first come out and to this day resent that. The game is in every sense of the word broken, guns spawn on the tops of towers and in sheds, but not inside military bases, barracks, or police stations, due to the additions of new guns ammo is now impossible to find making the game no longer true combat between players but rather a guessing game of does he have ammo or not, when the zombies are killed they create a huge empty space around their body in which a player cannot actually move through, something i found out after killing a zombie in a hallway and getting trapped by the invisible wall it created seconds later. The whole idea of item conditions has almost completely ruined any aspects of pvp, making it utterly useless to kill someone unless you can 100% get a headshot on them, otherwise all of their loot is ruined and therefore 100% unusable by any other player. They added in cars that are randomly found broken down and in need of repair but dont actually give any player a chance to fix them due to the fact that tires, parts, gas cans, etc. cannot even be put into the biggest backpack in the game, only carried in a players hands, meaning that to repair a car a player would need to spend hours of their time collecting 1 part at a time and running back to fix it. Characters also cannot hold an extra gun in any backpack, a major inconvienance coming from the mod. Every player also instantly becomes gifted with the blessing of lightspeed metabolism, making them hungry every 10 minutes and only full after eating 23 full cans of beans or 20 or so drinks just to get to a point in which they will not die from hunger or thirst. If a player was to get knocked unconcious in the game, dont bother trying to save them, there isnt any way to recover, as soon as a player gets knocked unconcious they just die after awhile despite any attempts to save them, epi pens, cpr, saline bags do absolutely nothing to help this either. Did you also know that you could get killed from rain? cool right, if you stand in rain for too long all of your clothes become damp and give you hypothermia, sickness, etc. which pretty much kills you if you dont have the right items to combat it, and if your clothes become wet there is no way to dry them off, ever, unless you are to build a campfire and wait around it for some time. In its current state i rate this game 3/10 its garbage and fails in every way to live up to its name, i hope that in the future it will finally work right and not be absolutely stupid, but seeing as the only progress made since december of 2013 was the addition of new guns and useless buildings we may not see any positive changes until 2020',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm a big fan; I often look for Early Access titles that seem promising and support them, unlike most I realise that most EA titles, you're in it for the long haul if you want anything substantial. Luckily for my timing though, this game already has a lot to play around with and enjoy! To see the game at it's current state and know that more features are on the way is very re-assuring for an EA title.\\nSo far the bugs have been pretty easy to deal with and with a little experience, easier to avoid the second time around.\\nStonehearth will generate a map for you then allow you to pick a starting point on the map, with three relevant resources markers indicating the abundance of trees, wildlife and minerals that you'll need in order to survive. Once you've chosen your spot, you'll have seven citizens, each with different traits that affect how they act in the world usually in a minor way.\\nYou assign jobs to your citizens and from there, it's up to you to manage a good balance of food, town worth and military all while trying to keep your citizens happy. The game has a 'Journal' feature that lets you look at the gripes and praises of your citizens for a given day, helping you to figure out the path to keeping your town happy as well as helping you keep a decent RP mind set if that's your thing.\\nIf I'm honest, I wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews of some other players, but it seems most of them just don't quite get the concept of Early Access or indie game development (you know the ones, on every EA game after a few months or years, complaining that a smalll team reliant on early access and their own money can't make a game as fast as a major studio with a massive staff of experienced full timers). I was shockingly and happily surprised by this game and cannot wait for mods to become more common place. If you like town builders with lots of customization, resource management sim type games, then this is differently worth a peak.\\nI'll update this review as the development progresses, as it stands if they just polished out the bugs and released it the game would still be worth my time, but my review would be much less favourable. Reading about their ideas and plans, and seeing what they have already, definitely gives me hope that these people are serious about this game and to be honest, I cannot wait to see more.\",\n",

In combat, soldiers move and shoot according to a system based on time units identical (?) to the original; so the combat is pretty much like you would expect, except there is a directional cover system implemented, oh, and suppression. Air combat is no longer 1v1 and now you can directly control your aircraft, a mini game that can become tedious with time, but a welcome change nevertheless. I prefer the art style of old X-Com, Xenonauts looks a bit ugly to me. I didn’t play this game a lot but from what I saw the game has its own take on a lot of little things. One thing that stood out and I liked is the introduction of shields. I think the game is OK but I wasn’t impressed with anything, and in the end I just didn’t find it exciting to play.\\nRating: XENONAUTS-COM\\nRecommendation: The game is not bad but there are similar games that are a better option if you are a fan of the genre.',\n",

       "  'text': \"For me, this game is the best the Elder Scrolls has to offer. Sure Skyrim has more smooth combat, animation and graphics. But despite all of that Oblivion has something greater, variety.\\nTo start off on this point, Oblivion has a whole mess of enemies to face from Imps to Ogres, fulfilling a more high fantasy feel than Skyrim. I have taken time out of my own day to essentially list up the amount of actual different enemies. Meaning entirely different races rather than renames with better equipments with individual models against Skyrim and Oblivion has a vast amount more.\\nNot only in enemies is where Oblivion shines against the low amount of variety versus Fallout 4 or Skyrim, it also shines in the fact that the environments vastly vary. We get the well built, structured and upper class Cheydinhal and then we get the snowy and smaller hut-like houses of Bravil.\\nEven the regular environments and weather seem to be in greater volume than Skyrim. I can tell Bethesda put their hearts into this game, even if the graphics were lacking even for the time, they're not overly bad to the point you couldn't play even today.\\nThe Shivering Isles is the greatest once more of the DLC that Bethesda has released, they attempted to live upto its likes in Nukaworld but failed in my view. This will be the greatest piece that Bethesda has released for quite some time and even if you aren't the biggest fan of Oblivion's main story which outperforms Skyrim's greatly. Then at least this part will provide a good use of your time and will entertain you even more after its completion.\",\n",

Aliens Colonial Marines practically destroyed the reputation of Aliens in Gaming, but this game shows when your in space noone can hear you scream.  The graphics are amazing, its one of the first games that really gets the look right, everything is highly detailed, EVERYTHING!\\nThis game is Sigourney Weaver approved, because its a story that makes sense, unlike Aliens Colonial Marines which was a COD clone in space.  Read more here:\\nThings that kept it from a 10/10\\n-The audio is just as annoying as horror movies in the theater.  At times the game is quiet then with no warning the game will blow your speakers making your ears bleed.  Theres no way to fix this so the dialog audio and the SCREECHING super loud audio are equal.  So you just play missing most of the dialog at times.\\n-Suffers from the same problem as DOOM, no flashlight on any of the guns.... at least when they reboot this or maybe as DLC they can sell a Duct Tape mod like DOOM BFG had.\\n-The Map sucks, probably the worst map ever made.\\n-the biggest reason:  LENS FLARE!  Looks like it was put into the game by an 12 year old making an edgy image using photoshop or adobe premier.  Lens flare isnt created by just lights flashing, look out the window at night at cars or windows they dont create lens flare, that is from the refraction of light through glass.  Without looking through glass or someother translucent substance the only way to see lens flare with the naked eye is if you squint your eyes real hard until they water can humans even remotely see lens flare with the naked eye.  Hollywood been goofing with this too lately ever since it got added to their post production suites, so its kinda meh, but is annoying with no way to turn it off.\\nRating 9/10  Value:  $24.99\\n*Would be higher if it included all the DLC and stuff.

It seems to have all the hallmarks of an excellent game. So why did I stop playing it after only a couple of hours? Because it plays too much like real work! Not that I actually have a job like that, but at tedious paperwork that makes up the core of the gameplay is the sort of stuff I use video games to escape from! And then it makes me worry about my virtual-families finances on top of that? Honestly, I was starting to stress out more from the game than I ever actually did in real life. No thank you!\",\n",

This is a brilliant concept for a game and has great potential, but it's spoiled by the people put in charge of it. It works I suppose, mostly does what it says on the box, but you kind of forget about that part while wondering how they let it out the door like this. The whole thing feels rather cheap and unfinished, all the graphics look pretty childish, the story has no structure, there are little to no instructions/tutorials for the user, and the maps are nothing but  big images with some hitboxes. It's confusing to try to play through because there's no direction usually. As said previously, it plays like a promising alpha of a game, but for some reason the developers thought that this was good enough for final release. I can't really nail down why this game feels quite so cheap, but I imagine that's because everything is the problem. Everything needs some work.\",\n",

I can tell this was something of a passion project, so I don\\'t want to bash the game too hard for its lack of gameplay balance or anything resembling a meaningful story. The gameplay itself is basic shoot \\'em up action with permanent upgrades that carry over between stages. I suppose the main attraction of the game is its \"infinite mode\", which I just found to be infinitely boring. Not to mention that the bosses become way harder, but the game doesn\\'t tell you that. Just stick to playing the regular stages, unless 10 to 15 minute boss battles are your thing. The upgrades were fun and rewarding but I quickly realized there were some blatantly overpowered ones. Your best bet is to save up all the ink you collect and get one of the super late game weapons early on. You will breeze through the rest of the game. Spreading out your upgrades and incrementally upgrading them bit by bit is actually a terrible idea. Overall not recommended since there are so many better shmups you can get for cheaper.',\n",

One plus is that the MP has different game modes that are alot of fun (Using CoD Names: Search and Destroy, Capture the Flag) among others. The PC port is very well done, getting 120+ FPS all the time with absolutely no drops. In my opinion it was very well worth the sale price of $20 for the complete package.',\n",

       "  'text': 'IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I\\'ve player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).\\nWhy, you might ask me? I\\'ll tell ya.\\nThe background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.\\nThe map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that♥♥♥♥♥♥is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.\\nForget everything else about other\\'s game crafting. This is THE♥♥♥♥♥♥\\nYou can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad♥♥♥♥♥mode on a bike.\\nYou can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.\\nCraft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I\\'d spend all the reviews talking about it.\\nAlso, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.\\nAfter all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.\\nIt\\'s a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.\\nThe game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.\\nAwesome.\\nThe game is partial-PvP. I mean, it\\'s not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.\\nThe game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it\\'s owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.\\nThe game also have a lot of player\\'s guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.\\n- Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special.\\n- F2P (doesn\\'t matter to me, but it\\'s nice to try for free if you\\'re not sure about it).\\n- Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc.\\n- Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat.\\n- A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends).\\n- A LOT of creative skills that you don\\'t see everyday.\\n- Welcoming and active community (don\\'t let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).\\n- Deep and beautiful scenarios.\\n- Scary voiceover (turn it off, man).\\n- You have a flashlight.\\n- Immersion feel on every step you take.\\n- Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world.\\n- Awesome PvP.\\n- You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast & Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback.\\n- You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?)\\n- Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.\\n- One thing I dislike in this game is it\\'s name. Should be called Awesome Earth.\\n- Performance issues on some PCs.\\n- \"Dated\" graphics (I\\'ve player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!)\\n- \"Hardcore\", even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game \"hardcore\" for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point.\\n- Unfriendly interface and learning curve.',\n",

The game seems to not want to communicate very well, with scant notifications or pop-up messages telling you whats afoot in your empire. The diplomacy is pretty light, though not the worst in the world. But for a game about ship combat, there's a surprisingly small amount of control, as aluded to earlier, you get no notifications when your ships are in combat, nor can you zoom to your ships or padlock ther camera on a ship (only your flagship and any ship you manually take control of) which makes the game seem incomplete. So many features seem unfinished or rushed and there's no word from the DEV on fixes or further development. The game looks exactly like Distant Worlds and attempts to play very similar but is a far inferior product and I'd reccomend that game over this any day, on account of it being a complete and enjoyable product, unlike StarDrive.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"When The Beginner’s Guide came out last year, I was intrigued by it. The trailer for it was odd and the connection to The Stanley Parable was intriguing. So, I gave it a go recently and I’ve got some thoughts about it.\\nTBG is a first person narrative video game in a genre that’s often described as a walking simulator. It’s about a player experiencing the narrative the developer wishes to share with minimal interactions. In this case, it’s mostly pressing switches, responding to a very basic conversation system and looking/walking around. It’s a pretty passive experience for an hour and half but there’s enough to keep the player invested.\\nThe Beginner’s Guide’s narrative is about Davey Wreden showing off the many small games of an unknown developer called Coda.\\nbut I did wonder for a second in the initial opening. I mean, it wouldn’t be the first time that indie creators came together on a game. But alas, this is a fictional tale. Davey is doing all of this because Coda quit developing games a while ago. So, Davey is showing the Internet these games and his perspectives about them in a bid to get Coda developing again. As Davey narrates, he talks about how he sees Coda through these small little games. That he thinks they give him an insight to who and what Coda is. However, as the game goes along, I start to get a disturbing sense of where this might be going. This was confirmed at a certain point. Davey talks about how he shared these once private works with others because he thought Coda was depressed and needed help to keep going. That Coda needed validation to pick them up again. As someone who is an introvert, I had a feeling that he had gone too far. Coda confirms my suspicions by breaking all contact with him after giving him a final game to play. In it, Coda states very clearly that Davey has a problem, a need to validate himself through Coda’s works and that Davey had taken things way too far by sharing it with others. That he is under the mistaken impression that he knows Coda through his games. Even worse, he had told others that Coda was depressed because of what he interpreted from a couple of games and had changed them through his own edits because he was unhappy with how the games played out. Even though it was distorting Coda’s work. However, it was a problem Davey must work through, not Coda. While all the time, Davey has been changing the work to suit himself and perhaps shows his own failings while doing so.\\nUpon finishing the game, I had quite a bit to ponder over. About my role in sharing other individuals’ work and how I review videogames. That maybe I do this entirely for my own selfish reasons of needing validation. Maybe a small part of me does, but it’s not the guiding force. However, I do think the more cynical interpretation that I’ve seen from others, of what is presented in TBG, is perhaps missing the point it's trying to make. It’s hard to say for certain, of course, but I do think the developer is trying to get the point across….see, it really is that easy to trip up and make the same mistakes Davey makes in the game. I think that this is a game best left up to your interpretation. What the dev may or may not have intended is for him to know. What I can say that I got from TBG is a cautionary tale. That pretending to know someone just based off of their works is dangerous. However, if the point trying to be made is a cynical one about reviewers and how they harm devs or profit off of them, I have one thing to say to that. That I’m in this to share videogames that are worth experiencing I am merely here to talk about and critique what I see as both good and bad ideas in said title. I like to think that what I’m doing is more of a net positive for the developer than myself. But, that’s how I view things. I’m sure some would disagree.\\nRunning off of the Source engine, TBG has all of the expected video, audio and miscellaneous settings that are usually included. Honestly, this game is so short that it’s not really worth listing them all out for you. But if you’ve run a source game like Portal 2 before, then that’s what you can expect to find here. It has good performance and isn’t that demanding to run. I didn’t experience any bugs or issues to report.\\nSumming everything up, The Beginner’s Guide had given me something to ponder. This collection of short games narrated by a man who may have obsession and personal issues to work through is a different experience. It may be a little bit more cynical of reviewers if one particular interpretation of events holds true or it may just be a disturbing look into Davey’s mentality and personality. Either way, it’s a game that requires a pause to consider the implications of not just other’s actions but our own. And perhaps, that we shouldn’t so quickly judge that we know someone based on their works. The game runs well for it’s 1.5 hour runtime and is really only worth playing the one time. But what an thought provoking time that one playthrough is.\",\n",

       "  'text': \", for all its quirks. That is, you're more interested in an interactive story where your choices are mostly reflected in dialogue, rather than changing major plot points. Where the outcome is largely the same but the details along the way become your own - a customized telling, so to speak. If that style isn't your thing, then this won't be either.\\nThis might well be the most successful transition of another intellectual property to Telltale game I've played. The Borderlands series seems at first like a really odd choice for a story-based game, given it has always been about shooting guns and then looting better guns. But beneath the violence and over-the-top style of humour, the games have always had heart.\\nSo it's in this bizarre setting that two non-action heroes can really shine. The game's world is utterly insane, but everyone knows it and they just try to roll with it.\\nSure, it's a horrible death world where masked psychopaths regularly have murder for breakfast, but it's still a world where people have family, friends, and dreams. It's cartoonish but never consequence-free, and though death is practically the wallpaper, it's still something to be afraid of and sometimes mourned.\\nThe writing is enjoyable and mostly maintains a good balance between silliness and seriousness. Moments of drama are interrupted by someone's awkward phrasing, or a surprisingly easy solution to the problem. Characters maybe are a little too self-aware, frequently commenting on their own actions even as they do them, but there are\\nthat hit the mark along with oodles of physical humour. I laughed out loud more than once.\\n. Instead of the usual set of grizzled mercenaries spouting one-liners, the dual protagonists are a corporate jerk and a devious con-woman. You alternate between controlling each of them, and their adversarial relationship turned begrudging respect is consistently fun to play around with. They're not action heroes, but you're frequently plunged into situations the heroes of the main games would have shrugged off with barely a sweat, and so you're left to see how normal people would deal with it.\\nThere are plenty of gems in the supporting cast as well. Some faces are familiar, but for the most part it doesn't rely too heavily on returning characters. They're mostly cameos, temporary allies, or even opposition along the way, but they're never the main focus. The cast is brought to life by\\nby some of the best talents in the business, though the typically clunky facial animation can take away from that a little.\\nAlso of note, as ever with the series, the creators have\\n, making for some awesome musical action sequences to introduce the episodes. I have at this point frequently had to admit I found certain bands I like through the Borderlands games.\\nThere was just a whole lot I liked about this particular story. From its pacing, to its characters, to its consistent tone. I would say there are a few narrative missteps that I won't get into here, but my final feelings are thoroughly positive.\\nbefore playing this. Major plot points from that are glossed over without further explanation, so it would be best to know them. It draws from the Pre-Sequel as well, but not as heavily.\\nOverall, if you enjoy the setting, and want to know what comes next, this is a great way to enjoy the universe from another perspective and in another style.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Zagreviews\\n-Magic Duels\\nSo, I\\'ve been playing this for a while now. I\\'ve been a fan of M:tG for years, so there are going to be a few different points I\\'ll be covering in this little review, coming from both a game play stand point, to how the game is transferred from physical cards, to a digital version.\\nSo to start off, the gameplay is a little tricky at times. Especially for people who are new to Magic.\\nThe tutorial, which grants you gold to purchase cards with at a later point, seems to cover as much as it can, but at the same time, it is a little monotonous. I\\'ve never encountered a game before where I had to click \"Do not show this again\" when tips popped up on the screen. I suppose I\\'m used to games where once a tip shows up, and you click out of it, you don\\'t have to concern yourself with it popping back up every time an event occurs.\\nOther than the slight issue with the tips, the gameplay is fairly well explained, from receiving your first hand, using mulligans, to laying lands, playing creatures, going over creature abilities, how to use them, and even going so far as to guiding you in regards to a red arrow that pops up over cards that the game suggests you should play.\\nThe downfall however, is unless you\\'re playing Versus mode against another player, the game continues to try and baby you through the campaign. Cards you have in your hand, often have that red arrow over them as the game is trying to get you to play them.\\nCampaigns to me, especially in a competitive card game, are generally ways to get you more familiar with different card types, colors, strategies and the like. But with this \\'suggested card\\' arrow popping up, it really feels like there\\'s little to no freedom. Of course, you can ignore the arrow and play your own cards, but there\\'s just something nagging in the back of your mind, wondering if something is going to go wrong because you didn\\'t play a suggested card.\\nIt seemed a little uncertain to me, playing throught he campaign, as to if the enemy AI was scripted to react to said cards or not.\\nOnce the campaigns are completed, you have a nice little chunk of gold to purchase your first starter pack with, and that\\'s something that I do enjoy about this game, is the ability to play without paying. Of course this is your stereotypical \\'pay-to-win\\' game where you can drop a bunch of money into it, and attain all kinds of cards. But if you\\'re willing to work for it, it can be quite rewarding.\\nMy only issue with it being that in order to get money, you have to win against someone in a random versus match, and that the winner only receives 30 gold, and the loser receives nothing.\\nThis is very demotivating. Especially if someone can\\'t afford to pay for cards.\\nImagine this :\\nYou finished the tutorial, finally. You go to the store, get your starter pack, and open up some decent cards. With these cards, and the starter cards you unlocked from the tutorial, you decide to go and build yourself a sweet little deck.\\nOnce satisfied, you head into Versus mode with your head held high with determination and confidence in your deck and your knowledge in playing this game.\\nYou get your♥♥♥♥♥♥stomped.\\nOkay. Maybe that was a fluke. You can\\'t win them all, right?\\nNext game. Wait. What kind of card is that? How come I don\\'t have any of these awesome cards that this person has? Okay, well I guess I just have to endure it and keep playing.\\nTwenty matches in, you\\'ve lost 16 matches, and won 4. For all of your playing, you\\'ve accumulated 120 gold. Not even enough to buy a single booster pack, which totals in at 150 gold.\\nI think that a person should get at least a minimum amound of gold, even for losing. That way, at least with all the losses, you can still afford to update your deck every once in a blue moon. But with the way they have things laid out, (And of course I understand, they need to make a profit off of this game somehow) it just seems that  the game punishes you for doing poorly, and barely rewards you for a win. Why not make a limit to how much gold you can get a day from Versus? Maybe a 300 daily gold limit for wins and losses combined? Maybe it\\'s 50 gold for a win, and 5 for a loss. It\\'s not a lot, but at least it\\'s something, and you\\'ll have more people motivated to play the game in order to get better when they can\\'t slap their wallet on the screen just to get more cards.\\nI don\\'t know, that\\'s just me I guess.\\nThe earning system is really the biggest issue to me in this game. It\\'s a struggle to preservere when you don\\'t have good cards like people you\\'re put up against. Of course there\\'s a lot of strategy to playing said cards, but at the same time, not everyone is going to understand that when they first pick up this game if they\\'re new to Magic.\\nThe game itself, the story line in the campaigns, the characters, the deck customization, the box customization, the play itself, are great. I\\'m horribly addicted to this game, even though I\\'m one of those guys who can\\'t afford to throw money at my monitor.  This is, in my opinion, a great Magic game.\\nThings I might change however, would certainly be the earning system.\\nI am hoping that they come out with more updates/expansions for this. The fact that there is a limited amount of cards means that there\\'s going to be limited amount of things to work towards. Sure the game play is fun and all, but building a collection is also part of the fun.\\nIf you\\'ve made it to this part of my rather winded review, then I sincerely thank you for your attention. If you are into magic, give this game a try. It\\'s a little dodgy getting into it, and understanding how the interface works, but after the tutorial, you\\'ll be making people rage with blue control decks, or red speed decks, or grave digger black decks.\\nThanks for your time.\\n-Zagru',\n",

       "  'text': 'I have played and followed this game for a long time, but I cannot recommend it for several reasons. First of all, the PC version is unplayable at current. This is not a single-player game. Unless you want to do the trials (which I spent most of my time doing), you won\\'t have fun offline. To really experience this game, you need to play against human opponents. The online on PC is extremely laggy and inconsistent and slow in terms of the matchmaking process. But the other reasons I wouldn\\'t recommend it are as follows:\\nToo dependent on match-up knowledge. You can\\'t counter-pick, which forces you to learn ONE character and learn them well. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. After having cleared all trials and experimenting with every character I still haven\\'t found one that works for me. Whether I win or lose seems to be decided mostly at the character select screen. My performance is not representative of my skill level due to the character I have chosen vs the character my opponent has chosen.\\nNo opportunity to use combos. This might sound like a noob thing to say but despite having excellent execution when in training mode I can never combo anything online not because I can\\'t make the links, but because the opportunity to use it is rarely there. The risk vs reward makes it difficult to justify at times. This combined with the non-existent juggling mechanics mean you have to rely on bread-and-butter combos. This makes the game far too \"flow-charty\".\\nToo much poking. Everything in this game feels safe and hard to punish.\\nAnd finally, the most important one: NO TUTORIAL. This game is about as accessible as twister is for wheelchair users. There\\'s nothing in the game to help you. Altthough the strategy and fundamentals might be intuitive, the controls and mechanics take a lot of practice and aren\\'t actually all that satisfying. The game requires frame-perfect timing and is infuriating if you don\\'t have the patience.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, this is by far my most played game and I\\'ve had some great moments on it, but to me it\\'s more fun to watch others play it (e.g. Excellent Adventures). As a spectator game, it\\'s often more exciting. But to play? It\\'s more furstrating than rewarding.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The best Star Wars strategy game you will find. Galactic conquest mode is great, allowing for battles across land and space of 50+ planets as any of the game's three factions. Bonuses gained while occupying planets diversify it quite a bit and sometimes makes you want to keep the planet rather than blow it up with the Death Star. Don't look for great depth in this game. You have money that is given on a regular interval, which is determined by planets controlled and mining facilities built on them. Use this money To build units or buildings. Diversify units to counter enemy units well.Conquer the galaxy.\\nThe space battles are amazing and what really make this game great. Being able to target specific functions on larger ships (smaller ones like a Nebulon B Frigate, up to a Star Destroyer or Mon Calamari Cruiser, even to a Super Star Destroyer) serves great purpose. The ability to send bombers in to take down shields with proton torpedoes, for example, is a great use of this as it disables the shields on the ships and makes them vulnerable to laser fire. Units  are well balanced, Empire may get the Executor or Death Star to conquer space and destroy planets, but Rebels get Garm Bel Iblis who can sneak past fleets and invade the ground with his powerful shielded tank- capable of winning over many planet systems.\\nOverall, a great game. I mostly played this as a child when I had it on CD and played a ton, but I do not regret buying this again. However, if you are looking simply for a RTS there are better ones out there (Age of Empires 2, for example). Get this for the impressive Star Wars universe.\",\n",

The seemingly unescapable \"click the exact pixel\" puzzles. In spite of all that, Machinarium has undeniable charm and style. Beautiful art, one of my favourite video game soundtracks. Clever puzzles to accompany a gorgeous game.

I would love to call them a game critic/educator.One thing they always say when they recommend a game is not that it's good but it does what it claims well.\\nNow they recommend this game on the cool gimmick of you can takover any ship you see and use it's cool ability. That's really freaking cool and fun. Got to try them all out. Shield flying guy was my favorite.\\nProblem is the game is boring when you have to play through 9 levels which are about 2 mins each, but most of them are boring. To me they feel like filler, which is funny thinking 2 mins of a level is too long. But multiply that by 50 levels and that's alot of not fun happening. The best think about this game besides the ship swapping is the extra mode: Boss rush which takes most of the boring levels and takes you to the challenging boss fights one after another which is quick and a blast.\\nLevel 7 boss is so hard for me.\\nOk so how do i rate this. Should you get it or should you not. Well it's fun but only for about an hour which is what i got out of it. Not for $10, but for $1 included with 3 other games(Payed $15 on bundle, got like 10 games, Hand of Fate was one and Ether One were the 2 big games included). Now that's not too bad. I wish there was a middle ground, like a thumbs sideways if your not sure.\",\n",

The moment it got cheaper (50 %) I bought it and have to admit that I got excellent fast-arcade-first-person-shooter-experience. If you have 3d vision you should definitely try the game as it looks excellent and immerses you straight ahead (make sure using helix-fix). I understand the critics that the level design is somewhat linear and may get boring after a while, but overall I would say for 7 hours first play through I never felt annoyed by the same kind of levels, actually I had fun until the end and the bosses are epic, are huge and afford a little bit effort in tactics - not a lot so that you won't get bothered fast. I would love to say sth to the Multiplayer, but it is not possible for the reason that no one plays it. Overall I'll give it a 7/10 which is very high on my scale. Check it definitely out if you play 3d vision. If you don't, you should get it when it's cheap. It still has a great design, great gunfights, great achievement system, and much fun!\",\n",

Extremely long queue times, and the only map I ever seem to get is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Super Mario map.  The movement is slow as hell and wonky, which is weird because I played it several months ago and it was smooth.  Although, maybe it's something with that terrible Mario map that slows down the movement?  I don't know because I never get loaded up into another map.  The only time I did was at the end of the match and I loaded into a safe room or something and was stuck in place, couldn't move, couldn't spectate, I was just stuck there.  I apparently can't get loaded into a game that is unranked, as it always tells me there are no matches available.  I know this isn't so much the probelm of the developer and more that what players are logging in play those modes, but if there was a larger player base it wouldn't be an issue.  I was really hoping KF2 would be KF1 with updated graphics and some new gameplay additions, but it fell disgustingly short on all of those aspects.

The ending of this one kinda sucks and the story isn't very good aswell as character developlment is pretty lackluster.\\nBut if you'r like me and you want to focus on gameplay this is better than the first primarily because its much less frustrating. You won't get stuck being stunned and knocked around and the combat is alot smoother but theres even less variety of enemies it feels like. Neither of these games really do anything new besides physics stuff, which is alot less a focus in the 2nd game, but both games are still enjoyable with all their faults. The only gameplay thing that really annoyed me is the focus on alot of  QTEs to defeat enemies aswell as the final bossfight which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and isn't very well setup as I fell during or after cinemeatics without any real thing I could have done.\\nWhat is good is that its a relatively short and simple hack and slash game without to much junk but that is also its downfall.  Its an okay game but nothing worth rushing out and buying new, I pity the people that bought this game for $60 and the first probably wasn't worth that either even though it is a slightly bigger game.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"One of the best RTS 4X strategy games out there.\\nThis game is about pure survival, you will try to use whatever tool necessary to make sure your empire sees another day.\\nIt offers the four mighty Xs, Exploring the darkest corners of the solar systems or entire sectors. Expanding your empire by colonizing all kinds of different planets, asteroids and stations. Gathering basic resources which you need for your empire's growth and most importantly eliminating rival opponents in both single or multiplayer matches.\\nOne of the greatest features of this game is actually the option to zoom in onto even the smallest objects in the space. Therefore you can enjoy some really beautiful sights of awesome ship and building models and space battles.\\nYou can take control over large amount of ships which you can even asign into custom fleets to ease issuing commands.\\nThe game's soundtracks are one of the best I've listened to while playing any kind of strategy games, simply marvelous.\\nBoth single player and multiplayer gameplay is really smooth and solid. All the base game races are surprisingly well balanced. Every race has its pros and cons, but they share a kind of a basic setup from where the different specializations start off. What really surprised me about this game is that you can actually host a multiplayer match on a public IP with an access to your router's port-forwarding rather than crating LAN or Official lobbies.\\nThere are few things that actually dissapoint me about this game.\\nOne of them is the lack of any sort of story based missions or a campaign, which is really a shame, because the littly backstory of this game is really interesting and is surely worth pointing out.\\nThe other, but not the last thing is about the not very efficient AI difficulty levels.\\nUsing increased income bonuses and faster research as a buff for higher difficulty AI is in my opinion wrong move and it is nearly impossible to defeat highest difficulty AI in a regular match just on your own, without anyone else to balance the enormous pressure on, because the enemy's economy overcomes you in just few minutes into the game.\\nOther great thing worth pointing out is the support for mods. There are plenty of awesome mods out there, which can really spice up the gameplay of the base game or add an entire new experience with something new, using conversions.\\nAs of the DLCs, If you find yourself enjoying this game at first, and you kinda get into it I certainly recommend adding both of them into your game as each of them adds some minor things and tweaks that can really improve the overall gameplay experience of every match you play.\\nI've played this game for more than a thousand hours in total off-steam and I enjoy every battle I manage to win or lose decisively or just by a pure luck. SoaSER is love, SoaSER is life.\\nWithout anything more to say, I would rate this game by 9/10 for how awesome it is.\",\n",

That\\'s the basic description of the gameplay, but there\\'s a deeper story involving children who are endlessly amusing them by constantly buying junk to burn in their \"Little Inferno Fireplace\". From what I read on the web, the game is a satire of casual gaming and while I see hints of that in some of the items you buy, it didn\\'t seem blatant that it was making fun of microtransaction gameplay (other than making you buy items, but at least those items will give you more money than what you paid, instead of arbitrary time to spend in a game), so I think the joke falls short. There\\'s a deeper message to be found through your communication with a neighbor who is also \"playing the game\" and what happens to her once she burns her house down due to playing too much.\\nYou start with a fireplace, a catalogue, a small inventory. You start out buy burning toe terms of service and end user\\'s license agreement which results in a little money to order from the catalogue. All items can be burned for money that results in a profit. The orders are delivered to you over a set time frame and once recieved, can be opened and thrown in to the fireplace in which you can burn them with left click (your only control). The most amusing part is just burning various items and seeing how they react to each other and what item combos are named after burning related items - which give you stamps to have items delivered to you faster. This does however, make me wish an indie dev would make a similar, higher fidelity game that would take advantage of better PC system specs and a modding community.\\nI had fun with this game, including being able to burn photos from my network of friends on Facebook, and the humorous tone of the items delivered and the overall experience of the game - not to mention the game does a great job burning items in a beautiful display of fire. I was able to finish this game in 4 hours, which is all I needed, though, there is more replayability through an alternate ending and finding all the combos.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Wow, what a great \"good game-bad port\" example. After playing Final Fantasy V on Steam (and enjoying it), i guessed that Final Fantasy VI would be an equal or greater port. But i hate to say that i was wrong. This port is terrible. Sure, it\\'s completely playable to 100%, but it\\'s ugly to look at the entire time. The sprites and backgrounds are pixelated and incohesive. The interface sucks. The diagonal movement here is terrible, even with a controller. Likewise, inputing Sabin Blitz commands is terrible because of the diagonals poor sensitivity. I recommend you playing it in windowed mode with a controller, it helps a little bit.\\nBut make no mistake, the game itself is great, one of the best JRPG\\'s that i played in my life. There\\'s a great story with a great twist in the middle, great characters, NPC\\'s and villains, the combat is good, exploration in a airship is fun as always, and the music brilliant, especially the opera compositions. It\\'s the best classic, 2D Final Fantasy hands down and i recommend every fan of the genre to play it, even it you choose another version. This version has achievements, but that\\'s little compensation. Over time, i managed to get somewhat used to this version, even if it doesn\\'t have the same feeling as the other classical versions. If you really want it, grab it on sale. Despite the crappy port, it\\'s compeltely playable, even if it\\'s frustrating at times.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Starseed Pilgrim is a very unique game. Most of the fun comes from experimenting with the different colored blocks and figuring out what everything in the game world means. Nothing is explained when you first start, but the game doesn't penalize you at all and lets you explore the mechanics as you teach yourself how to play and develop your own strategies for succeeding. In the simplest explanation, you place differently colored blocks to try to get more differently colored blocks and grow your tower while escaping the spreading darkness. Each colored block behaves differently, so the engagement comes from figuring out how to optimize your block placement to get as far as you can.\\nI don't think Starseed Pilgrim will keep you coming back for too long, but it's the kind of unique game you should try for a little while to see what works and what doesn't. I would recommend if you're interested in abstract indie titles or if you're a game designer looking for more unique study material.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I got this game in a bundle, and was unsure whether or not I wanted to keep it. After reading numerous comments and reviews about MKH, I decided to give it a try - and was really happy to get a chance to play through it.\\nIf you enjoy Japanese-themed swordsmanship with challenging technical mechanics, fighting mobs of enemies, and grinding for upgrade systems, then you will really enjoy this game.\\nThe aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the different character models is very good, and the fighting special effects is well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding a high level of intensity to the brutal, fast-paced gameplay. The cutscenes are short but sweet, and add an anime-like feel to the narrative. Although fairly basic, the story is decent enough to keep you interested in the plot (although the fighting mechanic definitely is the shining gem for this game).\\nThe controls can be challenging to learn - especially if you do not use a controller. The move list and tutorials are helpful, however, the default keybindings make keyboard play unnecessarily difficult. That being said, I completed several playthroughs without a controller (I will be attempting to complete it on the hardest difficulty with a controller, since keyboard play is far too brutal), so it is possible if you have no alternative. The learning curve is moderate to challenging because the later stages (and higher difficulties) really require you to utilize more advanced moves - like countering and parrying. If you cannot do this in the later levels (and/or difficulties), you will not get very far.\\nEach \"level\" consists of multiple waves, followed by a boss fight. Every enemy type follows a particular attack pattern that you can memorize and use to your advantage, adjusting your playstyle accordingly. For each kill you make, enemies may drop health or experienc orbs - experience is added to your total pool, which can then be used in the abilities store (you can access this at any time by pressing ESC).\\nThere are a variety of things you can unlock and upgrade - in particular, improving your health and \"katana energy\" gauge (used to perform moves with your sword) is crucial to survival and chaining more combos. Improving your normal attacks will allow you to do more damage, refill more of your energy bar (hand-to-hand attacks refill your energy), and increase attack range, among a multitude of other things. You can also unlock a deadly counterattack, which is essential for defeating higher-tier enemies, and even bosses. Special attacks can also be unlocked and improved, however, it is entirely possible to complete at least one playhrough without further enhancing these things (it will just make it more difficult).\\nFor achievement hunters, it can be both very fun and very lengthy to unlock every achievement in the game.\\nOverall, the game is a lot of fun, and technical players will appreciate the depth of the possible fighting controls and combinations. Definitely give this game a try.\\nRecommend!\\nCheers,\\nDJSF',\n",

       "  'text': 'The story itself is terrifying. I\\'ve studied up on the kholat incident and it truly is unexplainable.  But what the game tries to do fails on every level.\\nSo people will look at my game time and think \"How can you know what the game is like with only half hour of gameplay\".  I\\'ve watched many lp\\'s before puchasing.  I knew what I was getting into.  Watching and playing a game are different experiences.  My experience was very dismal and boring.  How you arrive at Kholat makes no sense early on.  You just get teleported there. Maybe the game explains this later on but i couldnt trudge through the boring gameplay long enough to figure that out.\\n+Good graphics.  Nearly constant 60 fps with a few 48 fps dips here and there.\\n+Sean Bean as the narrator.  He does a competent job.\\n+Good overall voice acting from other actors.\\n-Repetive gameplay. Pick up notes to learn the story and escape from the monster every once in awhile.\\n-Terrible save game feature.  If you die, you have to repeat sometimes several minutes of gameplay.\\n-Character gets exhausted from running literally after 5 SECONDS.\\nI paid only 8 bucks for this game. But these days, I grow weary of just walking around and picking up notes.  This technically could be considered a walking simulator game but there isn\\'t any survivival.  You don\\'t have to maintain water or food levels which I think would\\'ve added something more to the boring gameplay.  At least a cold meter would\\'ve been nice.  You are walking around in a literal blizzard for most of the game.',\n",

       "  'text': 'A definite curiosity, given that every unconventional decision the devs have made (e.g. graphics, music) is \"balanced\" by another decision stubbornly steeped in tradition (e.g. gameplay, sound effects).\\nFirst up, and most notably, the graphics. Equal parts beautiful and bizarre, both the aircraft and scenery were hand-crafted with models, and while this doesn\\'t necessarily make for the most aesthetically flawless game in shoot-\\'em-up history, it does make for one of the more unique-looking ones. There\\'s even roads with moving cars and tracks with moving trains on the ground far below you, and explosions created with the aid of firecrackers! It\\'s all quite charmingly \"Thomas the Tank Engine\"-ish, really (albiet from a bird\\'s-eye point of view, and with a slightly older audience in mind).\\nThen there\\'s the soundtrack, which is comprised entirely of swing-y jazz numbers. In an era full of gamer guys and gals whose idea of musical \"entertainment\" consists primarily of electronic bloops and bleeps, it\\'s a bold decision to say the least. And one which, I\\'m pleased to report, works alarmingly well (even if the two tracks on offer do get old kinda quickly).\\nBut if you think that all sounds a bit \"quaint\", like a video game from the 1930s which of course never quite existed, rest assured that the GAMEPLAY is straight out of an 80s arcade machine. You know the type of top-down shooters where you move up, down, left, right, and just shoot, shoot, shoot (and unleash the occasional screen-decimating bomb, for good measure)? Yup. It\\'s one of those. No twists, no innovations...exactly like the one you used to play in the corner store near your high school during lunch hours (yeah, I\\'m that old). And I wouldn\\'t even say it\\'s one of the BETTER ones of its type, given how repetitive the vertically-scrolling scenery and recycled level design quickly becomes. Oh, and to make things extra-hard, you only get one \"man\" (granted one with quite a bit of health, but once you crash it\\'s GAME OVER, chum).\\nThat said, perhaps the closest game this reminds me of - at least in spirit - is another recent-ish Steam release called Ballpoint Universe. That one did something quite similar with hand-drawn biro artwork and a side-on scrolling POV; but in all fairness, it did also attempt to add a bit of skewed storytelling and psuedo-platforming to an otherwise equally conventional 2D shooter. The end result was a bit on the baffling side at times, though, so The Blue Flamingo does ultimately emerge as the slightly more \"fun\" and \"accessible\" of the two excursions.\\nThis certainly isn\\'t a game which could be recommended for the gameplay alone (unless you\\'re the type who eats shmups for breakfast). But it is cheap, even when NOT on sale, and is certainly worth a look for the plain-old-curious, and even more so for those intrigued by the astonishing visual possibilities for games as we head into infinity and beyond.\\nVerdict: 7.5/10.',\n",

       "  'text': \"A long story-rich RPG game with decent battle mechanics that make you think. Finished the game within a week and that is skipping all the side quests after Chapter 2. It should take longer if a person wanted full completion. The main drive for wanting to play is that right from the beginning you start off with questions, about the main characters past and finding your dad that disappeared's whereabouts. It's the quenching for this curiosity that makes you play until the end. I find that most RPG's it's very hard for a game to hold your attention enough to make you play till the end and this game does this superbly. There are a lot of mysteries and well-built storyline in this series which explains why it is a trilogy.\\nThe characters are likeable and play a crucial part in the plot. Near the end of the story I found myself not sure of who to put in my party because I liked everyone of them and they each have their own strengths. They each have their own motives for acting and are very related to one another which makes it hard to think of them as just another party member that joins for reasons that are unbelievable. They join the party and leave because they have other things to do and the reason is not just the world is in danger so I am going to stay in the party from start to finish.\\nI found the battle system a bit slow for my taste (was fun for me nevertheless), but there are orbments/customisations that allow you to skip battles entirely. Even when skipping there are times when the game lets you farm monsters for levels allowing you to catch up on levels to advance the plot. The battle system is unique as instead of having critical hits there are bonuses on a specific turn and by using crafts/skills or ultimate abilities you can intervene or bypass a turn to prevent the enemy from getting said bonuses. Position is also crucial as if you bunch your characters up you can get hit by aoe attacks but it also makes the enemy come running at you in a cone so you can hit your aoe attacks more easily; also you can choose to make position your characters far so that it takes 2 turns to hit you. The game requires customisations to get skills and thus is very flexible with no strict warrior/mage development archetype.\\nThe music is excellent. I never get tired of listening to it - everything including the battle music, the map music, the OST that runs in the backgrounds for dramatic effects and the main character's harmonica song whereabouts of the light.\\nFor difficulty, I first started on nightmare and was a wreck, spent 6 hours in the prologue and gave up, it's near impossible on first playthrough. Hard difficulty seemed like it would take awhile to complete so I started off on normal mode just to know the story.\\nAll in all the game was a good experience and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel. I'll probably aim for 100% completion before that in my next playthrough.  I recommend playing this game if you don't mind the cliche story and/or slow battles.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Chiaroscuro: The Game.\\nOh boy, this game... as I tried to compose this review in my head while playing through this game, every opinion I had caught in my throat. Every feeling of awe at the game\\'s stunning landscapes turned sour as they were constructed around frustrating puzzles, every complaint at the periodically frustrating darkness cut off by the game\\'s fantastic score. It took me to the very end to decide if I would even come out with a recommendation or not.\\nI did.\\nNaissanceE is a exploration/puzzle game with an emphasis on the interplay of light and dark. Well, that\\'s not quite true. Because as a game, it\\'s not particularly good. As a portfolio, on the other hand? It\\'s FANTASTIC. This game\\'s developer should be given their pick of set design jobs for the rest of their career. \"Breathtaking\" is a word not used in much hyperbole here. There were several moments throughout the game where I had to simply stop and admire the amazing views I was offered. I\\'ve played amidst many amazing worlds in games, and I think this might be among some of the most impressive.\\nNaissanceE doesn\\'t have much - if any - story, and while a bit of context might have given a deeper appreciation for what I was looking at, ultimately it didn\\'t need it. The vastness and the detail of the seemingly endless (in every direction possible) cityscape spoke for itself. It felt timeless and haunting, the inevitable disquiet of any location simultaneously vast and empty. The soundtrack helped, with beautifully atmospheric tracks that perfectly suited the mood. I\\'m genuinely disappointed that the soundtrack isn\\'t an available purchase in the store, because this is probably the first time I\\'ve actually wanted to buy it separately.\\nAs I said at the beginning though, the game isn\\'t perfect. Many of the puzzles are franky awful - I must\\'ve toggled noclip on a dozen times after getting sick of the latest segment - and there are a few sudden, jarring tonal shifts that completely lose track of what the game is good at, including one chapter that is essentially one long chiaroscuro acid trip where everything becomes abstract and the music takes on a manic, wacky tone that doesn\\'t at all fit with anything else.\\nWhat ultimately landed a positive review on it after the annoyances balanaced out the game\\'s beauty was the unexpected appearance of a final boss. Without spoiling too much, after spending the entire game essentially alone, the final sequence is a terrifying chase that brings to mind the shoggoth encounter from H.P. Lovecraft\\'s original \"At The Mountains of Madness\" short story. A sudden heart-pounding finale left me in a good mood on the way out, predisposing me to a recommendation.\\nCheck it out, but don\\'t be afraid to cheat to advance. The scenery is what you\\'re here for. NaissanceE might\\'ve worked better as an actual walking simulator or a puzzle-free VR experience, but it\\'s still an absolute treat for the eyes and ears.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Hatred\\nIsometric shooter\\nDestructive Creations\\nDestructive Creations\\nis an isometric shooter developed and published by Destructive Creations, and has become famous due to the violent nature of the game.\\nThe story isn't deep and neither serious, paying homage to multiple exploitation movies of the 80s. You play as the Antagonist, a man who hates humanity and decides to commit mass murder until he dies. The dialogue is mostly said by the Antagonist, and is either painfully dumb or hilariously cheesy. This game is not meant to be taken seriously.\\nUsing the Unreal Engine 4, the game looks good and has great destruction. Unfortunately, the performance is very poor, the environments look bland due to the black-and-white style and the NPCs are not much varied.\\nYou go around and shoot people. The end.\\nAll joking aside, your goal is to go to points of interest and kill everyone that you find in the surprisingly huge levels. You can use three weapons at a time (ranging from pistols to flamethrowers) and three types of grenade as well as gasoline tanks and whatnot scattered around the environment. You can also drive some vehicles, but they usually destroy after a few shots. If a person falls to the ground and doesn't die, you can execute him/her in order to regain health. The animations tend to get repetitive and annoying, but you can disable them in the options. The A.I. isn't even all that smart, with civilians casually strolling by while you are stomping someone's head on the ground.\\nThe concept is repetitive, and if what you have read might keep you entertained, than buy this game. Otherwise it's not for you.\\nThe game is challenging thanks to the high number of police officers. You will mostly likely die because of explosions, getting run over by a car or simply not executing someone. The order difficulties tend to make the make more entertaining, while still not being too frustrating and impossible.\\nMost of the sound effects are fine, but the music isn't all that memorable. The voice acting is cheesy and the music lends itself to the nature of the game, with a hard-rock soundtrack that fits the gameplay but isn't all that great outside of it.\\nA total of 7 levels, 42 achievements, mod support and possible DLC make this a game playable once or twice in its current state. There are some secrets in the areas that you explore, but nothing worthile.\\nMuch ado about nothing. This game will be forgotten in a few months and we will all look back and laugh at how everyone overreacted. The game is a good time-waster, not that different from something like 1997's Postal or going on a mindless rampage in GTA. If you like the genre, you'll have a blast playing this.\\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Final fantasy VII is a classic, a game which deals with a lot of real world issues cleverly by mixing it into the fantasy world. It is a hybrid of fantasy and reality, with an industrialized/modern world meeting beasts and untamed lands. This game is however relatively dated (although some elements stand the test of time), but it is a must for any JRPG fan, as it offers traditional turn based combat, an intuitive magic (materia) system, lots of \"sidequests\", a strong narrative and an open world to explore. This game captivated me when it was first released, and even to this day continues to do so. Final fantasy VII also uses humor throughout the game, and gives you \"options\" with how to handle scenarios in the game, which impact the world, it is therefore a game you will find yourself playing again and again to revisit events and experience other paths (albeit all leads to same game ending). The cast of characters is colorful as well, and they have become iconic in their own rights. This game is designed with the \"traditional\" JRPG elements of the time, something not often seen today, as such it is worth exploring for both fans and the untested alike. Overall this game is a full recommendation, its style may not be for all, but it is a relatively accessible and enjoyable gaming experience and it is priced appropriately, giving you a substantial amount of game (30+ hours easily).',\n",

If you're looking for a Metroidvania, this barely qualifies.\\nWhile the art is phenomenal, and the puzzle platformer elements are decent, the game design is amateur at best, and the handling is often times rather floaty.\\nUltimately what you get is an almost completely linear game with some backtracking just to grab stuff with new abilities, intersparsed with meaningless combat and insufferable chase sequences.\\nAs a game, 7.5/10.  There are many flash games that would give it a run for its money in terms of content, controls, and enjoyment, but the entire package does a lot to show what video games are capable of as a matter of artistic elements, in that category it is superb.  For the money, it's decent value, though it has almost no replayability, but it's probably worth experiencing if you don't mind a 5 hour experience.\\nAs far as anyone complaining about the save system, or this game being hard, they're just bad at platforming.  Took me about 4 hours to beat without ever really getting stuck.\\nThat said, bugs could screw you over.  When I beat the game, Ori softlocked my entire computer.\\nSPOILER\\nAnd a warning to completionists:  After the Air Temple you will lose access to 75% of the area that it is in, and after you enter the Fire Temple there is no going back.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'is a puzzle/exploration game as a collection of quite unconventional happenstances. Even after fully completing the game, I keep contemplating over it. Then, the developer must have achieved what he was striking for: through a series of \"fourth wall breaking\" scenes and situations, this game made me think on a deeper meaning hidden behind the absurd. As mentioned by the creator: \"finding worth in the worthless\".\\nstarts with Anthony going to Sam\\'s party - a girl that he\\'s into as we know. The screen starts to get blurry with music fading on the background. The next thing we know, is that we wake up after a party hard and no one seems to be around. We wander within the mansion and stumble on Vincent, or rather Vinny - who prefers to communicate with us through old radios for some reason. He mocks, insults, and challenges Anthony at every step of his journey, for either finding Sam or getting the hell out of this damned mansion by himself. What will you choose?\\nThe game holds and utilizes all the possibilities of Unity3D, not marvelous, but pretty enough if used correctly. Yet, what the game aims to be is not beautiful anyway. It aims to be frustrating and enlightening at the same time, and it manages to be both. As a side note, you shouldn\\'t really try this if you have epileptic tendency, because you\\'ll be encountering sharp turns of the camera, sudden flashes and changes of light quite often. Even I got dizzy and a bit nauseated from time to time. The game has an unconventional loading system btw; each time you\\'d like to load an episode, you have to type in the name of the episode, so be warned. Attention is your friend sometimes; some other times... you\\'d better gaze elsewhere because you\\'d lose time out of curiosity. Achievements are a bit glitchy, so you should verify local cache from time to time to make sure they\\'d pop up when the requirements are met.\\nWith no subtitles or direct screen commands, you have to listen carefully to understand Vinny, think on it and react as fast as possible. The game keeps both your wits and reflexes sharp. Expect the unexpected. Think outside of the box. Even with the most cliché anecdotes, there is a hidden smart remark, a tongue in cheek mockery with the idea of \"common\". It is brilliant in a way, and peculiarly annoying and meaningless. Even for that paradox only, I\\'d recommend the experience.\\nConsidering it is a free game, there is nothing you\\'d lose for taking a glance. For me, even writing this review has been a challenge, since the whole idea of the game constrains you from declaring general opinions. Try for yourself. What you\\'ll encounter is nothing you\\'ve ever encountered before; that I can promise.\\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller\\'s Curator page\\n- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!',\n",

There's almost no characterization and they seem kind of annoying and whiny most of the 1st episode, hopefully they'll improve, so far the only characters that seem worth liking is Petra and Reuben.

Seeing it for a really low price on the HumbleBundle website, I shrugged and bought it on a whim.  I am proud to say that this game has won me over.\\nThe plot is pretty straightforward.  You're part of an inline skating gang that is trying to win the city of Tokyo-to via tagging.  You have to deal with rival gangs and police.  Sounds pretty simplistic and boring, but I think it's far from that.\\nThe soundtrack is awesome and won me over the minute the first song came on.  The environments, for a game that was first released in 2000, look really nice.  The gameplay itself is really fun, jumping around the environments and evading your enemies whilst trying to completely cover the area in colour, and I also took a liking to the characters almost immediately.\\nThe story is a bit lacking, but to be fair it's really not something that you focus on compared to the ever-so-enjoyable gameplay.  So what are you waiting for?  Get the damn game!!\",\n",

I still find the game fun even if the community does a huge amount of valve's job for them. There may still be people who love the game like me, but valve has to truly care more about the game and be more clear to us on future updates if they want to both keep players and possibly bring some back. I still recommend the game because, in my opinion this game still is great even with the recent mediocre and/or terrible updates. I have looked past it and will continue to look past it since i still have hope in valve. If you are new to the game then try to enjoy it for what it is now, since it can still be a hell of a blast.

Running low on fuel meant that I couldn't cook any food. Running low on fuel meant that I wouldn't be able to keep warm throughout the night. Running low on fuel would be the cause of my death if I did not do anything about it.\\nI had foolishly used up the majority of my fuel and wood beforehand, not preparing for the harshness of winter. Everyone on the streets of Sarajevo valued those two items more than gold itself - and rightly so. Being able to keep warm means not getting sick and trading away all of your goods for that bottle of medicine, afterall.\\nI had heard of a semi-detached house. Some thugs were living in one part, but the other was completely abandoned. I thought I could sneak on through and gather  what I needed to survive the winter, but I was wrong. I was spotted by a girl and she immediately opened fire on me. I bolted for the exit, managing to stay alive but now I was wounded.\\nI would not let her make a fool of me!\\nThe very next night, I sent another survivor in. This time, I was armed with a knife and a mission. I was going to wipe that building clear of these lunatics so that they can't hurt anyone else. I was able to find myself a nice hiding spot and lured the shooter into a trap. As the frail girl creeped by me, shotgun in hand, I lunged out and stabbed her. She fell over, and I continued to stab until she stopped moving.\\nI turned around to find one of her friends behind me, watching as I sunk the blade of my knife in and pulling it back out repeatedly. I prepared myself to fight this new enemy, but she just dropped to her knees and bawled her eyes out. I was stunned as two other girls came running out and completely broke down in front of me.\\nI had helped cover for a neighbor from the militia. I had given some brave children my only bottle of medicine and two cans of food when I had hungry people of my own. I had gone out to help people trapped under rubble. I ran through a street covered by a sniper just to help an injured man get back to his infant child. I thought I could still keep my humanity in this horrible war, that I could hold onto this ideal that people are inherently good.\\nBut I had become a monster.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"A definitively charming retro throwback all about the classic pattern and level memorization to survive. It holds its influence on it's sleeve, but for what it's worth this is no Strider; it is very much it's own game with a distinct personality.\\nThe difficulty is understandably high, with a lovely amount of bosses and enemy variety. The combat and platforming is decidedly stiff but functional, and thankfully the game is built expertly around that. There is a ton of variety spread throughout; everything from vertical levels to speeder bike chases to robot polar bear grenade fights, you'll find there is a lot of fun and balls to the wall insanity to be had. Nothing is impossible and everything has a pattern, just like the oldies. As polished as this game is, you'll find that there will still be the occasional cheap death.\\nThe later stages are a great test of your abilities, and I made the foolish mistake to come back to them after a hiatus. I now officially suck, and my rustiness means I'll have to devote even more time if I'm ever to see the end.\\nStill, I've played more than enough to make an opinion, and I can tell you with the amount of content present in such starkly glorious retro quality, Oniken is a beautiful yet flawed homage to the old games of yore, and serves to establish it's own tongue-in-cheek identity that many new age retro titles fail to capture. The price it's asking for and the heart that's been put into its production shows a game that everyone should pay attention to, even if some of us lesser skilled gamers can't get past the final few levels without suffering an♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Definitely worth a buy.\",\n",

I know that sounds like utter hyperbole, especially when people call tripe like Bioshock Infinite the Citizen Kane of games unironically, but its not, KRZ is amazing to an almost baffling degree for a video game. KRZ is an adventure game focused on exploration and character development, the main crux of the gameplay is exploring the Kentucky backroads and the enigmatic Route Zero and having a hand in shaping the cast's personalites and pasts along their journey.\\nA melacholic sense of loss and slow decline just permeates throughout the game.The graphics are minimalistic but beautiful and really adds to this lonely and mysterious atmosphere. The level design  and how its all framed is also great and it can get quite unique, showing the game world in different and interesting ways. The game's fantastic soundtrack also really adds to the atmosphere and  it is used to great effect making for some really memorable scenes. KRZ's writing puts every other video game to shame and it has a creativity and skill that most games lack. The characters are also quite likable and you want to see their journey through. Overall KRZ just sucks you right in and really feels like you're on an adventure into the unknown.\\nEpisodes have been slow going but its been totally worth it. Wait if you want to, but if you buy it now you will not be disappointed. KRZ is just a great example of what video games can do with storytelling and really needs more love.\",\n",

That alone is a red flag behind this particular title.  With 4 months between\\nand\\n, we can see that not much has changed.  Only that you now have recorded footage instead of still images.\\nFrom my experience, I thought that most of this experiment was mostly just an exercise to showcase basic programming skills along with areas of the developer\\'s own interests, perhaps following his daily mindset.  The footage is well shot and great for getting still images, but outside of getting snapshots, the player may find themselves bored.  The music is not quite something I would enjoy listening to for a prolonged period.  The best footage is clearly the \"watch the cat\" footage, because...well...it\\'s cat videos, what\\'s not to love?   The worst footage is by far \"going to the exhibition\", which is what my nightmares are made of.  (Teddy bear plushes disturb me.  Even moreso since most of these look like they came out of a horror show.)\\nThe developer even notes \"useless tips\" that only seem to inflect negative self talk, which not all developers experience.  But the worst experience that I\\'ve experienced would be the actual gameplay for the good ending (the game even warns you that the bad ending is far superior, which it is).  The background constantly changes (white on white is a bad choice half the time) and you would be fooled into thinking the size of the shapes to choose matters.\\nOn top of all of this, the developer has footage of him reading a comic, which I\\'m fairly certain is protected by copyright of the comic\\'s creator.  I\\'m not certain if this footage would be allowed, especially without being remotely mentioned in the credits.\\nOverall, do I recommend\\n?  Because it\\'s just a video-formatted\\n, I cannot see myself recommending this game for any purpose outside of using the footage to get still-images from.  As a game, this game is quite disappointing, most of the experience is of irrelevant footage that only seems to be focusesd on procrastination.  So, again, would I recommend it?  Personally, no.  It\\'s priced at $1, but I wouldn\\'t pay a dime for it (though you could easily make that back up with the trading card drops you can sell on Steam Market).\\n2/10  Only good for purposes outside of its intended usage.',\n",

       "  'text': \"A Story About My Uncle follows a young boy who goes off searching for his uncle in a fantastical world inhabited by frog people. To do so he uses a device which lets him grapple to most types of walls in the world. And that is the basis of the game's gameplay. It's a first person platformer where the sole objective is getting from A to B. There are no diversions here, there are no enemies or sidequests or an open world to explore. You can find some collectibles along the way, but that's about it. Thankfully the game is very short so the platforming aspect doesn't manage to get boring.\\nAnd to that point it's a shame that the developers didn't really fully explore the complexities of the platforming they created with this game. There are checkpoints on almost every platform and the time you spend in the air is very short, so if you fail you probably lost around 5 secs of progress, which makes the game very easy (but also not frustrating, which is nice). Only at the very end you can start stringing together longer grappling jumps as a new option to refill your grapple device in the air opens up. Everything else is pretty straightforward.\\nThe world that they set up also feels underdeveloped, there are only passing mentions of it in the narration, and not much is actually explained. Perhaps there isn't much time to do that as the game length is about 2 hours if you're going just straight from beginning to the end. You can do some time trails on all the levels, and you can go back and select the level you want to replay if you'd like to get some perfect run achievements. Other than that there isn't much replayability in this short game.\\nAll in all it's a good first outing from the developer, the game simply feels underdeveloped in a lot of areas. Get it on a discount and you'll be fine with the purchase though.\\n6 / 10\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A short, Western-themed 2D platformer in the Mega Man vein.   A solid little game which can beaten in around an hour.  Levels are short but have no checkpoints so dying restarts the level.  Not too much of a problem except for a couple of levels that accounted for over half of my deaths.  Some of the level design is of the \"you need to die once to know what to avoid next time\" variety.  There\\'s also the feeling that the devs went down a platformer checklist when creating level features but some of the stuff they did is pretty cool.\\nBosses are pretty standard, not great, not bad.  Enemies drop gun power-ups and they\\'re mostly in the Contra style.  There\\'s no up/down/diagonally shooting, though you can shot while crouched and jumping and this stops feeling restrictive with a couple of minutes of playing. Your health bar doesn\\'t do a particularly good job of conveying how many hits you have until death, as you\\'ll get killed at times with what looks like to be a decent chunk left.  Game would\\'ve been better off just having some type of numeric representation of health, those this isn\\'t too big of a deal.  There are no game overs, you have infinite attempts at levels.\\nThere are three playable characters, Clive, Ms. Johnson, and the duck.  Ms. Johnson is clearly inspired by Peach from Mario 2 in how she controls, with the big difference between her and Clive is that she can float for a bit on her jumps.  The duck cannot hurt enemies but can jump/fly and is more of a challenge run character.\\nAll said, a decent little game with some replayability, though a bit on the boring/bland side at times but hey, it\\'s 2 buck at full price.  Worth picking up if you\\'re looking for a Mega Man-esque platformer.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a 2.5D physics platformer that combines both Trials HD and Evolution into one package. You are tasked with getting across each level as quickly and with as little crashes as possible. Looking at some screenshots of the game you may think it is an action packed racing game but in reality it is about overcoming various obstacles in your path by using careful precision. Keeping your finger on the acceleration key will make it far more likely that you will crash in a spectacular fashion unless you are really skilled at the game. You can crash as many times as you like and still get a bronze medal as long as you cross the finish line but to unlock more levels to play you will need to go for gold or at least silver. The fewer times you crash and the quicker you get to the finish line, the bigger your reward will be. Aside from medals you will also be rewarded with cold hard cash which you can use to customize your rider and the bikes in your garage.\\nYou will automatically unlock new bikes the further you get into the game and they all have different ways of handling. Some may be heavier and slower while others will be fast and very prone to flip over if not careful. Handling aside, each bike you unlock is a straight upgrade to the one you were using meaning that you are unlikely to use those bikes ever again. There is one bike called the Micro Donkey that is unlocked by completing any track without crashing or leaning though for the life of me I could not accomplish this so I have no clue as to how the bike is. Customizing your bike and rider is solely for aesthetic reasons and has no effect on gameplay. You can color each part of your bike individually, making it look like you painted your bike with whatever spray paint you could find in the dumpsters if you so desire. As for different parts there are very little to choose from so most bikes will look the same minus their colors. Same goes for the rider, not much clothes to pick from though you can color him however you please.\\nStarting off you may be wondering which of the two games you should start off with but it doesn't really matter as you will have to constantly switch between the two as they are tied into each other. Whatever medals you earn in either will count toward your total to unlocking newer, harder tracks so you will have to play through both game's easy tracks in order to unlock medium difficulty ones. You can use the same bikes, same rider and the gameplay is exactly the same so it is very seamless, making it feel like one giant game. With the combination of two already decently sized games you will have a ton of content in this edition of the game. Trails HD no longer has its original soundtrack unfortunately and instead shares Evolution's soundtrack for some reason. Evolution also has a setback in that its DLC is not available for the PC which is really unfortunate since they were very fun. This version is by no means awful but I would suggest getting them on the Xbox 360 if that option is available to you.\\nPort quality of this title is solid, ran well and I've experienced no glitches or crashes. Most people's issues seem to be with the added Uplay DRM. It runs far smoother than the 360 version especially when there are lots of explosions going on, which is a large portion of the time. It being a 2.5D game means that the explosions going off in the background can't harm you and are there to look cool. You can only move to the left and right of the screen though when you are sent hurling off your bike after a crash you can fly face first into objects that can't normally be interacted with. It is a small unimportant detail but it never gets old sending your poor rider spiraling off the course and directly into some explosives. There is no gore or blood, he will just ragdoll into objects while occasionally letting off a very goofy scream. Trials does not take itself seriously at all and it is always tongue in cheek about things such as the descriptions for the levels that are often times references to movies or other forms of entertainment.\\nIt is goofy, it has respawn points littered seemingly every couple of feet and you can respawn as often as you want but Trials is by no means easy. It may start off as seemingly easy and boring but it will quickly kick off the training wheels, leaving you to fend for yourself as it giggles making you slowly drive your way over a row of highly explosive barrels. These insane, nonsensical things it puts you through is a huge part of its charm and in no time you will be riding through a WW2 battlefield, a floating island full of giant stone golems and a haunted castle to name only a few. You never know what to expect next since the theme of each level varies so greatly and so does the level design. Even after you think you have mastered the levels near the end of the game you will be able to earn a 4th platinum medal which require 0 faults and little time wasted. They are by no means necessary as by the time you unlock the ability to earn them you will have already unlocked all the levels, they are just there to add replay value and earn bragging rights.\\nAfter reaching the extreme difficulty tracks I'm just happy to get through a track and couldn't believe when I managed to get a silver medal on an extreme track even if I have played Trials since 2009. A neat feature incorporated into the game is the ability to view other player’s replays to see exactly how they got on the leaderboard and learn a few tricks from them. The community can even use the built in level editor to upload their created levels which are often time as good or better than the professionally made ones. It is a pretty powerful editor and I have seen the game turned into a First Person Shooter which was pretty mind blowing but honestly not that fun. There is tons of user created content to go through however the PC version has their own community that is separate from the Xbox version. That is really unfortunate since the Xbox version has been out much longer and has some amazing user created levels. Nonetheless what is here is typically pretty good and you will not be running low on tracks to play anytime soon.\\nAside from your typical tracks you can play through a variety of “Skill Games” which massively change up the core gameplay with crazy ideas such as attaching a rocket booster to your bike, riding on ski gear or flying a UFO. They are very creative and a ton of fun to play through a few times though they lose their appeal quickly. If you are low on medals they can be a lifesaver since they are usually easier to get gold on and there are a ton of skill games to swift through. The other mode is a simple tournament that has you riding through a gauntlet of tracks in order to gain some medals. Each track has their own leader-boards where you can compete against friends and strangers as well as a feature where you can upload your playthrough of the level directly to Youtube. There is just so much content to the game that you'll likely be playing it for a long time if the gameplay is to your liking. A demo is available on the Steam store page which is rare for a PC game but much appreciated and allows you to see if this is your cup of tea before buying. If you have the option of buying these games on the Xbox 360 I would suggest getting them there as Trials HD would feature its original soundtrack and Trails Evolution has some really cool exclusive DLC for it. If not, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is still jam packed with content and is a very unique, addicting game that everyone should give a shot.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'What is up everyone I hope you are having a wonderful day. Early access is always a risky gamble but here’s one where the risk is literally almost free. We’re tuning into a 1v1 ranked match in Brawlhalla and we’ll kick started it with that.\\nSo far I will recommend this game. However, I do not suggest you buy any additional items at this time unless you are willing to try and be part of what could be the next big \"super smash\" on steam. ***This game has improved since it\\'s inception*** and has added some major updates to refine and introduce new features. As the big giant blue sign says though, the game is early access.\\nIn short, Brawlhalla is melee with the giant exception most of the battles can be fought in the air and some crazy and odd combos can be strung together. Also, here is a cool feature off the bat : the loading screen to play another online game let\\'s you battle it out with AI\\'s while waiting. Unlike Super Smash Bros. : Melee specifically, the game doesn\\'t have a \"fast\" feel to the game play. Rather, the game is smoothed out and requires proper timing (and the right button) to deliver an effective blow. The game is played generally in the air but the ground attack specials provide for more than enough umph and entertainment. The challenge to out whit your opponents seems equal at almost all odds. Some players will choose to take a precautious route while others will be willing to sacrifice themselves for a win.\\nBrawlhalla mimics in it\\'s corridors super smash. It is because it seems as the first reference to come to mind. On the other hand, it isn\\'t as I feel the strategies are really diverse and open to the player. There are character limitations and powers in both games but changing and throwing weapons distinguishes brawlhalla. Getting knocked off the map has become avoidable with all characters. When you think you\\'re dead or when you have no chance, it seems playing fields are almost even all the time. The edge of the map is a different game entirely here from smash. Think of kicking a soccer ball versus a golf ball. Being able to slide on the edges opens up a new dynamic (and possibilities) for both players. It seems as those who simply wait to strike at vulnerable times seem to win the most.\\nThe game is persistent in it\\'s work to differentiate itself from smash. Is this a good thing or bad thing you may be asking yourself? It\\'s neither really, until the game is done then a full judgment can be made. The scoring system seems to play the odds of K/D ratio\\'s while the HUD display simply shows it\\'s awesomeness in the top right (although I wish that awesomeness was a tad bit bigger in sprite size)! It\\'s tough sometimes keeping up with the fights, but the camera does a pretty good job of keeping you right where the action is. In other words, the zoom is definitely on the right track. Multiple game types make this game phenomenal. I can jump online with friends and play a free for all or play some two player ranked. It\\'s actually pretty nice to see considering it\\'s in the state it\\'s in.\\nThere are weapon drops in the game which resembles smash, but unlike smash, you\\'re allowed to throw away your main weapon at any time. There aren’t random weapons like smash but there is some variety. The weapon-drop will drop and can be picked up within a certain time by anyone. Each character is given two weapons consistent of axes, guns, spears, swords and not limited to javelins. In this sense, some characters have preferred fighting choices and when unlocked, can change their fighting stances (which can modify stats slightly but limited to local game modes only at the moment). Items are a nice addition to the game, and do not feel as though they tilt the odds. The longer the player holds the button down, the more umph goes behind the shot. Items include a spike ball, a bomb, a mine, and my favorite, the horn. The horn creates a line of fire across the screen and even delivers another weapon to the position you blew it from. I have to admit that this style of weaponry is actually nice. It\\'s breath of fresh air as it\\'s something new. If you get tired of using this, try using this instead. Don\\'t like this, go back to the other thing.\\nGraphics resemble those of Castle Storm but there is nothing wrong with that. The art style is nice and again, sets itself apart from smash. Sounds are good, but I would like to see a variance. Make a sword sound like a sword (even when thrown), and make a javelin sound different than a sword when it bounces off the ground. Stages didn\\'t sit well with me at first, but they do change over time. I felt as though they were a bit small, I still do but I can see why they are the size they are. I would suggest adding some levels that are larger and try to stay away from creating every level about the same size. I do like the physical changes that go on in the map, again another + for being different from smash. If you really want to get creative, maybe add certain objects that can explode, upgrade, or slow down players in certain spots (and maybe make them usable every minute or so).\\n****SEPT 2016 update\\nEverything is in good shape and the servers have finally improved. Game play is literally feeling in good shape and would maybe even like to see more mini-games? 4v4 local? Anything is welcomed as there is certainly no shortage on skins. I would also like to see the in-game coins be put to some kind of use in the future. Right now, everything seems dependant on Mammoth Coins. Mind you, these are only artificial changes not game re-structuring ones. I wouldn\\'t mind seeing some more maps added in the future as well. They\\'ve been adding characters every so often but no new topography! I\\'m excited to see what the final-release will have in store.\\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 7.45/10 ***updated as Sept 2016\\nThe devs are actually really good at hearing out the community. Their also pretty effective in delivering their updates quickly in-game when it happens\\n***This review will be consistently updated throughout early access.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is really fun! The combat (while derivative of other TPS) is solid, and the enemies, the 'robot-gore', and the environments are cool. The game also looks great, and the design is fantastic as well - the cityscape is wonderful to look at and really feels like a great blend of sci-fi futurism and gritty realism, and the character models are detailed and instantly recognisable. But the strongest feature of the game (in my opinion) are the cutscenes. The script is well written and the performances are pitch perfect and committed across the board. More importantly, I can follow the story and am invested in the characters, and I'm enjoying this more and more as it goes on.\\nI didn't realise that voice-recognition was such a big part of the game, and while it's gimmicky and can be frustrating at times, it is great fun at times to yell 'charge!' at one of your characters and have them respond to the command, throwing themselves into the enemy.\\nEverything that's great about it certainly makes up for any shortcomings in my opinion.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I am going to break this into 3 parts, singleplayer, multiplayer, and cooperative.\\nSingleplayer: 5.5 out of 10, fun to play, doesn\\'t get too bogged down. Props to Kevin Spacey for acting the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it.\\nMultiplayer: 3.5 out of 10, suffers from the same flaws as previous editions, some enhancements and flaws thanks to the new abilities. Server ping is a joke.\\nCooperative: 8 out of 10, something new, instead of survival and relying on team mates to revive you in the midst of a 400 goons+ attack, you can let your team mates die, instead of having to run into the middle of a pack of goons, and better yet, they keep their kit. I rate this.\\nSpoilers will follow;\\nSingleplayer:\\n1- I am F#$KING SICK OF \"THE GOOD GUY IS REALLY THE BAD GUY\". Please, Activision, nearly everything you\\'ve done since you focused on WW2 has had this same tired plot device. It\\'s not inventive, hell, I could see it coming a mile away.\\n2- I am just as sick of having to do missions where I have no \\'real\\' control. In the final mission, I have to stop a giant missile full of bio-weapons from firing, and am in an exosuit running down a fire filled launchway. This was stupid, because I was on fire in a fire filled environment and would have cooked to death. None of your future gadgets can stop me from realising the stupidity. Next, I could only fire at the missile once I got to the end of the corridor thanks to \\'fake\\' control, aka, through the exhaust gasses, and only once I got almost directly UNDER the ♥♥♥♥ing rocket engine. Lastly, on this point, rockets don\\'t take 5 minutes to take off from ignition. It\\'s pretty bad for the fuel supply.\\n3- What\\'s with our new main character? He looks like a nerd. IS this because you want to touch your audience on a subliminal level? He has mangy long hair, his facial hair is something similar to a 19 year old uni student... actually, ♥♥♥♥ it, I completely understand what you did there.\\n4- The campaign would have been mediocre if it wasn\\'t for the inclusion of new abilities such as threat grenades and the exosuit, otherwise, it was the same campaign I have played over the last decade of COD.\\n5- Minor grumble, but when you have an \\'action sequence\\' where I\\'m hanging off the side of a bus, or have to knife someone, don\\'t give me exactly 1 second to see the prompt and act on it. I won\\'t make it in time, and you\\'ll reset to my last save, which was at the start of said scene, about 5 seconds prior. This annoys me, because there is no point to it. I get to replay the same situation, only I now know what button to mash because I did it earlier.\\nRemember 90\\'s games? Weren\\'t they hard? None of this \\'respawn 5 seconds earlier\\' crap, it was \\'continue from the start of the level?\\'.\\nMultiplayer:\\nOk, real review. It\\'s the last COD multiplayer with jumping and cloaking fields. The guns and upgrades are unlocked by player level and kill-rewards, so bad news if you\\'re a casual looking to have fun, because you will be mercilessly gunned down the second you spawn, and some 12 year old will proceed to tea-bag your corpse and tell you he ♥♥♥♥ed your mum. Add to this, you are unfortunately in for LAG BY THE BUCKET. There are no dedicated servers at the time of writing, and the game suffers for it, with instinct being almost unplayable, even on my ASUS G75V. By searching for games to join of up to 800 ping, the server sets you up for failure.\\nAdd to this, the fact that the way the weapons actually function in multiplayer is a joke. I\\'m not terrible at the game, (not great either), and I have got to level 49 on multiplayer before doing this review in order to build up a fair opinion. I often will shoot an AK-12 or Bal into a person, at least 5-6 shots center mass and they will turn around and 1-2 shot me. I often watch the kill-cam and confirm this, which makes me really wonder if they are just THAT GOOD or if there is something wrong with the programing.. Also, the laser weapon (not the attachment, the actual heavy weapon) is broken, and the term \\'laser noob\\' is commonplace, as people wielding a couple of lasers can lock-down a hardpoint or domination game. The sniper rifles and side arms are all terrible, also, the melee option is a joke, with players able to slice you from several meters (a meter is about a yard) away at times. The submachine guns can sometimes pop you from about 100 meters away, and the assault rifle damage at times is a joke. Also, some players seem to have superhuman damage absorption abilities, as you can often watch a killcam with them on the red with blood all over their screen running at you and still knifing you to death, all whilst you are registering hits.\\nCooperative:\\nThe only genuinely enjoyable part of the game. No zombies now, they\\'re gone, and I\\'m happy with that. Frankly, zombies was ruined when they made the last Zombies in COD Black Ops 2, where it was all hard, and no fun. I know, I regularly played Zombies with mates and we didn\\'t laugh during the last Zombies like we did in original zombies or black ops. Also, an improvement over Modern Warfare 3\\'s survival mode, as there are no juggernaughts, and enemies are not made of diamond and impervious to your bullets. This isn\\'t to say it\\'s not challenging, rather, the enemies are hard to kill because they are sneaky, and well armed, not because the developers are lazy and just dial up their health bar by 10% each round. Also, an improvement is no \\'levels\\' to perk up on your character. Instead, weapons and abilities are unlocked during game as a reward for surviving. I like this, because it changes the challenge. In Modern Warfare 3, survival till level 25 because easy once I was level 40, because I just brought a machine gun with red dot, and mowed down enemies from a camping point with a sentry gun until the bots were too tough to hurt (that limit btw is about level 30, where you have 2 machine guns and a sentry gun, and so does your mate, and you don\\'t kill anything with a full mag...).\\nAll around, the game is fun. I say fun, not good. The gripes I have about the unoriginality with the single player and the broken multiplayer cause me to negatively view the game. I personally recommend survival, it\\'s something you can enjoy with mates, and you don\\'t need to have the levels and perks. As always, stay away from the multiplayer. I judged it not just because I knew what it was like in the past, but also because I actually have played through to level 49, and yes, I have the good guns with good upgrades, but I still get killed by those 12 year olds. That\\'s ok, I can kick their♥♥♥♥♥at N64 Mario Kart or Sonic 2 on Megadrive.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I'm not sure what all the bad press is about aside from the fact that it's so similar to Civ V. Yes they are very similar in the way they play and look. For me, I don't really mind too much, although I am glad that I got this on sale.\\nBeyond Earth, I think is great. It's the kind of Civilization that I've been waiting for. I just cannot play regular civilization anymore as I cannot properly immerse myself into the experience when I'm playing as English or the Aztecs on a random map where Ghandi of India is a warmonger and Ghengis Khan is a coward who asks for peace every time a stiff breeze rolls through his territory. Not to mention the map: even if you download a realistic Earth map, you might be Japanese starting South America or English starting Russia, America in Africa. For me those kinds of things ruin the immersion, though I'm sure they don't bother most people.\\nFor me, Beyond Earth solves these problems. You take control of a fictional futuristic faction that has landed on an alien planet.\\nIt is very similar to Civ and yes it's quite a lazy sequel I suppose, but that doesn't stop it fom being great in it's own right. Personally, I think the best Civ game so far, according to my tastes. I do think that more effort could have been made though. For example, the different map styles are done very poorly. The land in Archipelago style maps is joined via slithers of land, actually creating large continents. Forget the secluded, isolated territories then, if you liked them. With some community maps, this game would be perfect.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Well, where do I begin? With the fact that this game is an amazing re-creation of vintage FPS games? How about pointing out the great in-game design of the playing field? I'll just keep it simple.\\nThis game is simply amazing. The graphics are awesome, the movement is fun, and the idea is timeless. I was browsing through the free-to-play FPS games to kill some time while I got my old copy of Quake 3 Arena set up again and thats when I came across this game. If I'm just being honest, this is pretty much a knockoff of Q3A, but it's dissimilar enough that I really don't mind as it's still a very fun game to play. Mind you, I've only been playing the free version which, unfortunately, only comes with one playable map. However, that one map has got me hooked. I think that the developers did an amazing job with re-creation, and took great care in crafting the playing field. The gameplay is highly immersive, and will keep you playing for hours (if you're into this kind of game). The movement mechanics are pretty fun, too, and make it a very fast-paced game, just like Quake.\\nThe BIGGEST problem I can see is that there is a very, very small payer-base for this game. It's unfortunate, too. I would have guessed that more people would be into this kind of game as well, but I guess times change and people's gaming priorities will as well. If you do come across this review, though, and you've gotten this far.. Please give it a shot? It really is worth the free download at the VERY least. As for myself, considering buying the full download, I'll most definitely reconsider if I start noticing a larger player-base. For now I'm perfectly content with the free version.\\nThanks for the amazing game!\",\n",

However, after finally having gotten to play it, I can't help but getting a sour taste in my mouth.\\nWhile the art design and animation is superb, the aspect that it truly falls flat on is the puzzles, and that's pretty bad for an adventure game. There are truly only a handful of variations of puzzles throughout the whole thing, only ramping up in complexity each time, and the only way I can easily explain them is: Tedious. It felt like a chore to work through these puzzles, and I was actively looking forward to the whole thing being over after a while. I can only describe it as being boring.\\nIt's sad, but this turned out to be a prime example of why Kickstarter is such a gamble. You can see the love and dedication that the team put into this, but it is also painfully obvious that they ran out of time and money a lot sooner than they thought they would, leaving an end product that is neither satisfying or ultimately worth your time.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Just finished playing Wolfenstein: The New Order from start to finish.  Like many gamers, I like to spread my time out among a few different genres.  Sometimes I focus on JRPGs or RPGs, other times I play in a sandbox like Minecraft or A.R.K. and then every so often I fire up an FPS to get the adreneline pumping.  It\\'s refreshing to get engaged so quickly with a FPS like I did with Wolfenstein.\\nNow that I\\'ve completed it, I feel like I can say...\\nOverall, Wolfenstein is a good game - the graphics are excellent, the gameplay is fun and engaging, and the environments are interesting and eerie.  Though, it starts off grand and slowly looses steam the longer the player plays.  The game reminded me of one of those little toys that children play with where they wind them up and then let them down on the floor.  In the beginning, the toy zips away at top speeds but as the game plays on, it starts to wind down.\\nAlmost as if the designers couldn\\'t decide on whether they wanted it to be a story-driven RPG first person shooter, or if they wanted it to be a maniacle \"blow everything up\" type shooter.  It falls somewhere in the middle, but it feels like it doesn\\'t commit entirely to one or the other.\\nThe story is rather \\'okay\\'- but that\\'s to be expected on a game like Wolfenstein.  It\\'s not exactly Mass Effect, though it was touching that they put effort.  The voice acting was top notch and the attention to detail was very well done (news articles, letters, journal entries, etc).  The addition of Set\\'s character really added to the story and they definitely skimmed the surface of some sickeningly familiar concepts that we\\'ve dealt with in the real world (torture, erradication of jews, etc).\\nFor the sake of the \"quick and dirty\" review, I\\'d say if you enjoy FPSs and you enjoy Wolfenstein or other iD titles, it might be worth checking out.  I know I got the game on one of the famous Steam sales, so I definitely feel like I got my money\\'s worth.   I\\'d recommend it for anyone that wants a decent 12 hours of gameplay for a quick exciting experience.',\n",

As an expression of grief it is faultless, but as a game, I have a few reservations. That Dragon, Cancer, is very much a mixed bag. It\\'s a collection of touching scenes in the life of a sick child and his parents.\\nSome scenes express emotion quite vividly, such as when the parents meet their doctors for an update and prognosis, when you navigate Joel as he is carried on balloons made of surgical gloves, when Joel will not stop crying in the crib, and when he is cradled on the chest of his father Ryan during treatment.\\nOthers were perhaps too abstract or left me confused about how to proceed, such as pushing Joel on the slide, helping Joel ride the animals created from constellations, or prodding Ryan to swim when he is submerged. On a few occasions, I seemed to - almost - perform the action that was required of me, but then the scene would reset for me to try again. It\\'s possible that either these scenes were meant to evoke futility on the part of the player or that the game simply moves on if a player \"fails\" a scene too many times.\\nThrough what is depicted here, we see hope and hopelessness, faith and spiritual doubt, helplessness, and confusion, among other powerful emotions. If nothing else, the game is entirely genuine and authentic - I\\'ve never played anything else like it.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Okay, this is an unfair review.\\nLet this be a warning to unfortunate people, like myself, who grew up (and continue) to use game controllers for FPS games. I knew there was no controller support when I bought this game, but in the end, I just don\\'t have the keyboard-mouse skill to advance very far in this game.\\nMaybe I\\'ll be able to pull it off one day... until then: Controller FPSers, beware.\\nEDIT (in reply to helpfulness of this review):\\nThere\\'s no neutral review, and I\\'m disappointed that I cannot play this game, so it\\'s a negative. I feel that \"negative\" reviews on games with an overall \"positive\" rating (this game, has an 86% Very Positive rating) are more instructive than the \"positive\" reviews. Potential buyers read reviews before they read the forums in most cases. The caveat of telling review readers my opinion treats the game in an \"unfair\" manner and describing why clarifies my review rating.\\nI\\'m not hating on the game, or giving a bad review out of buyer\\'s spite. I suck at keyboard/mouse FPS controls and I wish there was controller support. Controller support is within the developer\\'s control. I knew that going in there was no controller support, but I wasn\\'t prepared for the high difficulty level of the FPS platforming.\\nThe difficulty in the game design is perhaps another point to let people know about. I made it through \"A Story About My Uncle\" (another FPS platformer) without a controller just fine, and didn\\'t think that it would be a problem for DeadCore. But it was a problem, and I couldn\\'t enjoy this game. I was hoping my experience could help people to understand that.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Explore the zombie-infested city of Los Perdidos, and find a way to escape before a military strike wipes the entire city, and everyone in it, off the map.\\nDead Rising 3 is a tpp zombie massacre simulator. It follows the Dead Rising formula, by chance you end up as one of the survivors of the zombie apocalypse and you must fight to survive zombie hordes and non-zombie maniacs, and get out alive. It has a specific structure where most of the mission have specific timeframes, miss the timeframe and the mission is gone. It's not as bad as it sounds tho as these timeframes in DR3 are quite generous, so as much as there is not much time to just sightsee there is time to complete all the mandatory and optional missions.\\nThe game itself is fun as usual. There are hordes of zombies and lots of ways to free them from this place of existence. The combo weapons are fun as usual and exterminating hordes of zombies using max level combo weapons is extremely satisfying. The PC edition includes all the dlcs, each dlc is a side story to the main storyline, which means 35-40hrs of reckless zombie murdering.\\nFor me DR3:AE is the best franchise installment by far (haven't played DR4 yet). You're still time constrained but there is enough time to do everything, included dlc content removes the time constraints so you can just roam and kill zombies. And killing zombies en masse is what Dead Rising does perfectly. The story is crazy, but well written and fun. If you like zombie games then give this one a try.\\nI liked:\\n* story\\n* (mass-) killing zombies\\n* crazy weapons\\n* music\\nI disliked:\\n* fps-drops (gtx970, but ancient cpu)\\n* no freeroam mode after finishing the story (you can freeroam in the dlcs as they are not timed, just without the costumes)\\nGet this if:\\n* you liked previous installments\\n* you like zombie games (and have a beefy enough pc)\\nDon't get this if:\\n* you don't like zombie games\",\n",

If the game gives you a path, follow the path as long as you can and don't explore. Rae moves too slowly for exhaustive exploration except in the first area.  There are some achievements you can get by exploring, but this is another case of achievements ruining your experience.\\n- When you see cyan swirls, press the action button!  This is your only way to progress.\\n= THIS GAME IS REALLY FLAKY WITH CONTROLLERS =\\nI left an earlier bad review for it because I thought Rae constantly going in circles was a feature - no, it was just a bug.  That seems to have been fixed, but it randomly decides it can't see my XBox controller when I start, takes a reboot.  So if your controls aren't working, just reboot the pc.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Greetings!  Today we have Prison Architect; a building management tycoon style game done with a (very) simple art style that started out as early access and now appears to be fully released.  Does it hold up to other Tycoon games and can it hold on to your hard earned money in an age of triple A graphics and adaptive AI?  Uhh...Yup.\\nWhat are you in for:  The game is more or less a standard building management game where you give orders to have things built, areas watched and things crafted but have no real direct control.  The twist comes from the fact that you aren’t hosting tourists, tenants or dungeon delvers but inmates.  Inmates that not only have to be kept in line but taken care of with a careful balance of mitigating harm to prevent escapes or deaths but also encourage education and reform; at first I really only cared about the former but the later does become very important as you start optimizing your prison.  This is a very simple interface but does have a few bugs and poor quality of life decisions, not all of the options feel intuitive and some tool tips are just plainly broken.   Some of it you just have to learn as you go and from trial and error; leaving the game definitely in an unfinished feel.\\nGo directly to Jail:  The game has a single player campaign disguised as a tutorial.  This threw me off at first as I was actually trying to initially rush through it thinking it would be a few minutes of story and then on to a sandbox.  Well, I can tell you I was wrong…and I am very happy at that.  I won’t ruin the story as I found it enjoyable with several twists and moments that I was sure the game was trying to sell politics until it immediately turned the coin over and showed the other side.  I found this story oddly intriguing and I did find that I was rushing objectives to get to the next plot piece.  I should note that each chapter of the campaign does relate so pay attention to each chapter; they aren’t stand alone.\\nMeeple City:  The graphics aren’t initially something that you think would have much to talk about but I found that they conveyed the information needed while remaining charming.  This is odd because I tend to lean towards more realistic graphics, though I will openly admit the sound was very forgettable and I eventually muted it.  As I stated above the controls could use some work (would like to know what items have access points without having to build and move).  I will say that I would have liked to see some more interesting options during the sandbox, can I accept corruption?  Maybe I have a VIP who needs to be protected?  Have an inspection I need to prep for?  Dirty guards that are on the take?  I mean the options are endless, I’d love to see these added in expansions.\\nSo, does this oddly animated kickstarter turned release hold up?  In a word, yes.  Simply put if you like tycoon or building management games you will get your money from this game.  Though many will disagree I did find myself at the cusp of being bored when I finished but the journey was well worth the crime committed (yay prison puns).  As always, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!',\n",

       "  'text': \"This is both a review for Halo Wars Definitive Edition, as well as what I think it means if more Halo games came to Steam.\\nHalo Wars. On PC. I freaked out when I found out - 20 bucks for the original game, improved graphics (...sorta), plus all the original DLCs.\\nI got chills when I opened the game. Hearing that amazing soundtrack - one of the best put into a Halo game to date - oh boy, it gave me the memories when I played it on the Xbox 360. The good old days, when you had games like this to play every now and again, and have a copy of Halo 3 or Halo Reach lying around to play splitscreen with your friends when they come over to your house. This game is without reasonable doubt worth the 20 bucks. Great value for a great game. Story is the same as it always is, with some of the - if not the best - cinematics put into a Halo game. Story lasts a good 6-7 hours. which is a nice lengthy campaign for a Real Time Strategy game. Overall, it's good to see a classic return.\\n8.5/10\\nAnd I would like to see me. Much. much more. *cough* Halo 3 Remastered *cough*\\nNow that I got that out of the way, what do I think about Halo games coming to Steam? Do I want to see more? Absolutely. But only certain games. To me, the games that feature The Master Chief, (Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 4, Halo 5) should remain an Xbox Exclusive. That is because he is Microsofts FPS man. That deserves it to remain on console. But...for the games that don't feature The Master Chief? They would be a new revolution for Steam. Halo 3: ODST would make a warm welcome to Steam. Halo Wars 2 may even be welcomed. But I'm wanting the big Halo. The Best Halo. Halo Reach. A game with such good maps, gamemodes, customization, and creativity would become a new Bestseller. Halo Reach wouldn't be a Halo game on Steam. It would be THE Halo game on Steam. And if that day comes, which it could, but may not, then I will be the happiest person in the universe.\\n- i am sam\",\n",

       "  'text': 'A great turn-based strategy game with RPG elements. There are many aspects I like about this game, including the combat mechanics; although the game can occasionally seem unfair (how could I miss with 80% hit chance?), it is actually a well-thought out system that works very well for the most part. I like how there are two different play modes - one is the on ground combat, and the other is managing your base. Think of the management aspect like a simplified Civ game. You are responsible for hiring scientists and engineers, building specific rooms, managing finances, hiring soldiers, deciding which soldiers to genetically modify, to name but a few. I also like the way each solider type (heavy, assault, support, and sniper) have their own tech trees. They are slightly limited, but enough to keep it interesting. The expansion adds plenty of content, such as new missions, weapons, and enemies.\\nNegatives are fairly minor. I feel there could have been more environment types (they get very stale after a while). Animations are sometimes a bit off, not enough to ruin the flow of the game, but they are noticeable. There is one enemy where their turn takes way too long, and can be irritating to wait for it to finish, especially when you are looking to load to a previous save.\\nOverall, a fantastic turn-based strategy game. Certainly one of my favourite stratey games. If you are late to the game like I was and enjoying good strategy, I recommend buying this ASAP.',\n",

It lures you in with the promise of a better ending, only to sucker punch you at the end.\\nSo do I recommend this game? No, not really.

I'd happily pre-order any future final fantasy game from SE without a second thought.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Finally a game that is worthy enough to compete with games such as Amnesia or Outlast.  I have lately reviewed many horror games and they have all been more or less garbage compared to theese two.  Nothing comes even close until this game came along.\\nShortly the game is about an artist who delves deep into madness as he creates his masterpiece using methods and tools that are more than questionable. In the process everyone around him gets hurt really bad. As an added bonus there is a chapter where the daughter of the main protagonist later comes back to the house to witness the carnage of her childhood and pick up the pieces.\\nGameplay is harrowing experience of flashbacks and exploration as the road to madness really is something. It is worth looking for details in the environment,. Some gameplay related cons do exist though, for example early game is 'door opening and drawer opening/closing simulation' as some negative reviews have correctly explained. But as the madness progresses there is less and less of this and more... madness. And the painting does come along nicely and end result is something i did not quite expect.  Nevertheless i'd like to point out that the best parts are by far the narrative thick sections that explains what happened and the less than stellar sections are the endless corridors with yet another door to open.\\nGame does not have much action in it so those who look for mad running from enemies such as in Outlast will not find any. Also there is no hiding from monsters such as in Amnesia.  The beef of the game is to witness the quickly advancing decay of the family as everything goes to hell because of the protagonists obsession with a painting.\",\n",

While the layout of each mission is scrambled (as well as the topology of the \"hulks\" to explore), the randomness is quite low, so it doesn\\'t take much before everything gives a deja vu feeling\\n- rigid game structure\\nthe game is subdivided in seasons and, while it is a nice touch that fits into the general concept, it comes a time when you just want to either pick a random mission and get wild, or replay one of the missions you already did.\\nSure, there is \"The Void\": a streak of unlimited random generated missions, but they are differently structured and are not as satisfying as the original game [EDIT: the void is totally cool. At some point you build some tolerance for the spinning ;-) ]\\n- sluggish transitions\\nbetween pretty much everything there is a anime intermission with the pilot winking, the ship starting, ecc ecc. Now this is great when it\\'s done to hide some loading time, but the developers really overdid it. Guys, can I just shot some fu...rs, please??? :)\\nThat said, the game is so damn good, you can forgive it pretty much everything, as long as you give yourself the time to get a bit good with it: the dogfights are a chaotic mix of physics and environmental based combat where you dance and slide with your vehicle while transforming from fighter launching missiles barrages, and mech pulling and throwing stuff around.\\nThe graphics is stunning and the audio does its job remarkably, with touches of styles like the pilots intercoms during the fight (a nod to the anime material the whole game is inspired from), and the game is sparkled with humor and references (one of the enemy pilots is dressed like the protagonist of Guacameleee :DDD).\\nRegardless...\\nYou get to pilot a space ship that transforms into a mech, and feel like a total badass in the process. What the f#%$ do you want more than this?? =)\\nHighly recommended!',\n",

Fewer ambiguous puzzles, more substantial hints, and better explanations. All around the puzzles were much better designed, and as a result, I had a much better time with this game. The major downside, however, is that this game is easier than the first. Even the game's hardest puzzles only took maybe 5-10 minutes. A few puzzles might be more difficult for people with no background in math... something to consider. The story continues from the first and I thought it was decent, but it's more plot-driven and loses some of its charm in the rush.\\nIf you were able to stomach Puzzle Agent 1, then this will be a welcome improvement. If you're a fan of puzzles, this isn't as good as the Layton games, but it's cheaper and still fun.\",\n",

I certainly recommend it to those who like to solve puzzles and have a pleasant time. :)',\n",

Yet i kept thinking theres just not enough content, not enough maps, monsters, traps or weapons…then I released that during free weekend all the additional content was free so thats it, everything the game had to offer to promote itself and it was nowhere near enough.\\n- DLC, we all know about this…the costs are atrocious.\\n- Maps, not are they lacking in quantity but also in quality..how this has been overlooked is beyond me.\\n- Single player is pointless.\\n- There are 3 multiplayer modes…seriously and one of those is skirmish but the other two are identical. Evacuation tries to put a cinematic story edge to the multiplayer which is a complete and utter flop.\\n- The price, for the lack of content amount of dlc and small player base the only way this game is worth buying is for less than £10 with all the DLC thrown in or free to play with the DLC as micro transactions.\\nVERDICT?\\nI was genuinely having fun with this game but over time it becomes boring and how shallow it is becomes so blatantly obvious.',\n",

Playing Left for Dead as a kid kind of let me feel nothing in regards to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot, because there was no loot in Left for Dead. Why are you mentioning Left for Dead, you might ask? Well, this game borrows many concepts from L4D, (in fact, you can argue that Vermintide is basically modelled after L4D) such as the enemy mobs equating to those zombie mobs in L4D.\\nThat said, if you are unfamiliar with the Warhammer setting, it is quite easy to say that there is only war everywhere and everything wants to kill you (on a less extreme than Warhammer 40,000). The enemy of the game, the Skaven, are humanoid rat people who are overruning the city of Ubersreik. The description of the game by the developers offers a pretty solid explanation of what's going on.\\nVermintide revolves around you and three other companions (from a total of 5 to choose from, the Dwarf Ranger (melee/ranged combatant), the Imperial Soldier (same), the Witch Hunter (primarily ranged/mixed), the Elven Ranger (same), and the Bright Wizard (primarily ranged/magic). Completing a series of objectives to accomplish a mission, you and your party must venture through the rat-infested city to do so. It is quite fun, although replayability might not be a strong suit. With this said, bear in mind there are minor bugs and some kinks that the devs haven't worked out yet. If you can look past these, I'd say you'd love this game.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Dead Rising 4 is an open-world zombie-slaying sandbox, and it\\'s awesome. The world is rendered in loving detail. Honestly this may be the most detailed open-world I\\'ve played to date, other than RPGs like Fallout 4. Almost every building and store is enterable and fully detailed. Lots of objects are interactable and can be used to bludgeon zombies and hostile survivors. It\\'s just grade-A pure fun♥♥♥♥♥♥and a blast to play. The centerpiece of the setting is the Willamette Parkview Mall, a surburban megamall. Presumably it\\'s the rebuilt mall from Dead Rising 1. It\\'s an amazing and hilarious place to explore, complete with themed sections and employee tunnels. If you\\'ve ever just wanted to blow things up and have fun in a shopping mall, this game has that.\\nHaving said that, Dead Rising 4 has a couple of problems.\\nFirst, compared to the earlier games, some gameplay elements are gone. Dead Rising 3 has a more robust hand-to-hand melee system and you can throw weapons. That\\'s absent here. But I don\\'t really see any problems. My biggest complaint is that they took out the weapons locker from Dead Rising 3 so now you have to manually re-collect any weapons from their original locations. If I want the halberd I gotta go all the way back to Medieval Town in the mall.\\nMuch more serious is that they took out psychos and the psycho cutscenes. Having just started playing Dead Rising 3 also, I\\'d say that\\'s a big step backward because that game had some ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious psychos. Dead Rising 4 still has maniacs, but these guys lack all of the satirical humor of the earlier psychos. And no cutscenes of course.\\nThese cutbacks notwithstanding, the gameplay component itself is much improved from the earlier games. Combat is more visceral. The blood is more plentiful. There are dynamic blood arcs and splatters. Zombies number in the thousands on-screen, and performance remains great. This game actually has better performance than the PC port of Dead Rising 3 despite the vast improvement in visuals.\\nThe second problem is the playable character Frank West. A lot of people have a problem with his voice actor and appearance changing compared to Dead Rising 1 and 2. I never played those games. I don\\'t have a mental image of how the \"real\" Frank West should be like, but I love Dead Rising 4\\'s Frank West. The man is ♥♥♥♥ing badass and hilarious.\\nThe game does have a small problem with inconsistent tone. But I never found it as jarring as a lot of other players and reviewers. People make it seem like you\\'re watching Schindler\\'s List punctuated by Jerry Seinfeld segments, and that\\'s just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Does this game have a tone problem? Yeah. Like in one instance towards the beginning one character accidentally has an Anthony Weiner phone moment, and that spoiled the seriousness of the scene. But really egregious stuff like that is rare.\\nOverally, try it. It\\'s hella fun.',\n",

The enemy AI is really great and sometimes even challenging in certains parts of the game even in normal difficulty. You can play in which ever order and each one gives you a slightly different experience.\\nAs the Marnie, the game takes the traditional route like any FPS with you typical arsenal of weapons but with a survival horror twist. When playing, you really got to be on your toes and stay alert as the xenomorphs can pop out of nowhere.\\nAs the Alien, the game shifts to a 1st person stealth game as you lurk through vents and pick off the enemy one by one. Stealth is the key and the darkness is your friend. To regain health as the Alien, you must devour your prey. Playing the Alien is my personal favorite.\\nAs the Predator, the game is a mix of stealth and the ability to use your wide varity of gadgets with a touch of brute strenght. The predator is the more powerful of the 3, but however don't get too cocky. Predators can be killed too. To regain health for the Predator, he uses a gadget in his arsenal with also drains power. Just remember, electric weapons such as the blaster and should cannon use power.\\nThe game's story is not as great as the previous two Aliens vs Predator games and at times can be murky but it makes up for it in the gameplay.\\nIf you are a Aliens vs Predator fan, you will not be disappointed as it stays true to the Aliens vs Predator lure. I rate this a 8/10.\\nIf you know know nothing about Aliens vs Predator than this game could look average to the casual FPS gamer and may come on as a 6/10.\",\n",

I had no desire to spend 50 dollars on a genre that I don’t even enjoy that much, but at 14.99 I feel like I outright robbed the devs.\\nGraphically Wolfenstein is stellar; I didn’t encounter a single muddled texture or janky pop-in. Animations are natural and varied. The gun effects are meaty and unbelievably deadly feeling. Sound design reflects this quality with heavy, forceful gunshots and chaotic combat chatter as you mow down nazi foes. Everything about the presentation is just perfect.\\nBut every modern FPS is shiny, the problem is that they are all bland, stale, predictable, and just plain boring to play. Not Wolfenstein, dear god not this game. You are unnaturally quick, agile and can leap and slide about the stage whilst dual wielding assault rifles.When the game gives you guns, it wants you to go ape with them. On top of that, Wolfenstein goes back to the good ol’ days of magical bottomless pockets, allowing you to carry about a full arsenal of chaos to use as you see fit. Gunning down one room only to slide into the next stealthily tossing knives into the backs of any nazi whose back is foolishly turned is pure joy.\\nAs if making a good feeling shooter in this day and age isn’t reason enough to celebrate, the storyline and character development is mind blowing. Sure the emotions won’t be running as high as your first time playing The Walking Dead, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t swept away into the struggles of the protagonist and his rag-tag group of freedom fighters. With some seriously dark and difficult topics hit on with such taste and creativity, when the cutscenes are rolling it’s hard to believe this is an old school nazi killing arcade. That is, until the tone switches to absurd 80’s action movie mode and you gather around the round table to hatch a crazy plot to mow down more nazis. When you can go from entering a concentration camp-witnessing all the horrors associated with a locale of that nature- to melting nazis on the moon with laser assault rifles and never breaking the flow of the narrative or gameplay then you have accomplished something magical.\\nI could harp all day on how each part of Wolfenstein is expertly crafted, but the pinnacle of achievement here is the inconceivably masterful balance between so many conflicting styles, themes and narratives. Wolfenstein: The New Order is by far one of the best games I’ve played in 2015.',\n",

The secrets are easy to find, and the map does all the work telling you where the \"secrets\" are. The \"twist\" about being a lesbian and building up over Lonnie is just kind of a let down in the end.  The story told in letters does somewhat grab the emotions on the whole \"lost love\" feeling, but the payoff at the end just really drops the ball here.  I went in expecting more of a mystery over the whole \"psycho house\" thing you read about a little bit, and the odd phone messages, but it really leans more for the lesbian lover in letters collected.  Also, one gripe I kind of had was the fact that some of the letters, while really well designed, felt I could barely understand because of the handwriting curves (not all, but some).',\n",

Is it recommended? Yes, but definitely one for the sales!\\nThe bundled SiN is a better game but is of course much older and really hasn't weathered well at all. It also needs a special bug-fix downloading that is very difficult to find.\",\n",

All three stories are connected with logical connection, and what happened in GTA IV has affect on these two stories (EFLC - Episodes From Liberty City). Or let's say it has affect on it. It's not like it has some real affect, but it was made to have the affect on it. And it has.\\nBoth expansions shows something of both worlds. TBoGT is showing classy high & luxurious style of life while TLaD is showing underground, real side of America. In overall I do like TBoGT more, but Johnny was truly awesome in TLaD.\\nThere's also one mission where all 3 characters meets up but now shhh about it. Same with intro. For the price you see at Store Page, you will get two precise full games not just expensions as they are called. Also they're BETTER OPTIMALIZED than GTA IV. So you don't have to worry about your hardware as much as you had to back then with IV.\\n(for both)\",\n",

The cutscenes and cinematics are AMAZING as they are more animated and have better graphics than the actual game. Save points are common enough and there isn't a huge emphasis on grinding. However I like the battle systems from the earlier Final Fantasy games better, the battle system for FF8 is good. You need to press G right when you land your attack to deal extra damage. It's a cool little feature, but personally I prefer the more simple battle systems found in the earlier Final Fantasy games. Namely: Final Fantasy 3. All in all it's a great game! 8/10\",\n",

To me, it stands strong among others like Gothic for example, in terms of being unique and sucking you in.\\nIf you want to know what this game is: Ambiguous answer would be Dark Souls RTS, a better description would be very hard, survival, zombie, rogue like rts game.\\nThe good:\\n+ soundtrack - catchy and fits the theme\\n+ I generally don't like steam punk settings but this game pulls it off beautifully\\n+ zombie game done right (it's hard to use something as overused as zombies and make it interesting\\n+ simple elements put together skillfully\\n+ randomization of maps\\n+ decent array of building and defensive options, with soldiers having advantages for different scenarios\\n+ excellent combination of tower defense, rts and rogue like\\n+ plenty of resources to manage, basic ones: wood, stone, gold, iron, oil etc., slightly more complex ones like population, food and then complex like space, you have to not only think how to secure resources but plan your expansion and optimise building cluster\\n+ some buildings have impact on other and should be built in proximity to boost benefits of the economy\\n+ simple rpg like mayor system giving you small benefits, but also forcing you to make a choice\\n+ clear, neat, good looking graphics\\n+ major and minor zombie waves\\n+ zombie towns - you can attack them and get extra rewards or avoid but this could have an impact later on if you dont have the map cleared properly\\n+ Dark Souls of rts genre\\n+ learning from your mistakes\\n+ hard, you won't win every time, but getting owned by the game is so much fun as you usually lose because of your mistakes\\n+ sometimes randomised map seed is stacked against you but even if I feel I am at a disadvantage I am giving it a go to see if I can adapt to adverse conditions\\n+ frequent updates\\n+ survival mode already providing hours of fun\\n+ price tag wasn't overly big and given coming to the game (40-50h campaign, new buildings and units, workshop to allow moding and possibly map making with potential coop or multiplayer maybe, its gonna be super worth it, I feel it already is)\\n+ devs are fairly responsive, despite being indie company\\n+ fairly helpful community, lots of players out there who are willing to give you tips, there are guides available\\nThe neutral:\\n* some people report issues/bugs etc. but I haven't experienced any\\n* difficulty not aimed at beginners\\n* certain people can find this game repetitive - mostly because at this stage of the Early Access its just the survival mode\\nThe bad:\\n- at this point in time Mayor choices are not really choices, I mean they are either too easy or both options you are presented with are just equally bad\\nI know, it looks like I am a total fan boy but I can't fault the game at the moment, I understand this is Early development, there are bugs and balancing issues to fix, features and content to implement. I will have a more critical approach once game leaves Early Access officially.\\nHopes:\\n~ I am hoping the campaign won't disappoint\\n~ map editor (workshop confirmed)\\n~ new factions or maybe mods changing change would be cool\\n~ I would love to play a reverse version and control zombies XD\\n~ playable zombies to allow typical rts like games\\nI very rarely take interest in Early Access but I couldn't wait to jump and support this one, especially seeing as I have missed the Kickstarter campaign. With games like this one I am very happy for the Early Access option on Steam.\\nNumantian - you have done a great job, keep it up!\",\n",

       "  'text': 'If Max Payne 2 was a humble, faithful sequel that simply improved upon the technical flaws of the original while keeping mostly everything the same, then Max Payne 3 is the Hollywood blockbuster that broke new grounds for a wider audience who were unfamiliar with the original. This isn’t a criticism about Max Payne 3 being different from what people originally loved being forgotten for the sake of sales; instead, it’s recognizing that with Rockstar having full control of the series it’s not a game that adheres to what Remedy believes made Max Payne so beloved.\\nIn many ways, from its narrative and gameplay, Max Payne 3 is my favorite in the franchise despite how much fondness I have for the originals, and it’s simply because of how different it is in its style, presentation as well as deviations on the core Max Payne experience. That is not something I can often say about a sequel that changes so much yet it retains the identity of the qualities I enjoyed the most about the original. The foundation of what makes these games so great is still embedded within all the deviations that kept me coming back to spend as many rainy days of Max’s downfall in New York to the sunny reflection off his bald head in the turmoil of Brazil.\\nAlthough the term isn’t the correct film genre, Max Payne 3 is a neo-noir adaptation from the series’ original adherence to the classic film noir style with its own quirks. Instead of graphic novel cutscenes with as much grit and wit as a Harry Blotch novel, MP3 adopts in-game engine cutscenes both playable and not playable that make the cinematics part of the standard gameplay. Instead of the romanticized underground crime-organizations of New York, São Paulo is a realistic city full of corrupt officials from politicians to policemen fueling a cultural divide and an economy where the poor people fuel the elite upper-class. Even Max himself undergoes a visual change that makes him appear an angry gringo on a vigilante mission much like the original game where the language barrier itself becomes a part of the narrative that alienates Max as an outcast hero trying to do what is right in a part of the world where his Americanized notions of justice appear meaningless.\\nFor all these visuals, narrative and gameplay changes, they retain the ideals of Max Payne where they blend two mediums together, namely film and videogames, into a cinematic—not frame-rate related—experience into a league of its own. As a result, I can respect what MP3 attempted to accomplish as it manages to stay mostly true to the series’ roots while expanding upon them as sequels should, even though the Rockstar levels of adult subjects like pandering prostitution can take away from its social commentary on the real-world politics of São Paulo. If these changes bother you or make you question if you are playing the same type of game, then that was the purpose behind these changes as you are put into Max’s shoes of being unfamiliar from the conventions of his past games.\\nNot every change is easy to accept as others such as the constant visual effects on the screen that attempted to visualize Max Payne’s deviation from sobriety and his constant drug usage. Even if you can accept the changes in its storytelling, the Rockstar-ification of Max Payne from Max Payne 2 continues its lack of subtlety and campier elements that made the previous games beloved. Perhaps of all the controversial changes that will divide fans the most are the gameplay adjustments that may not be tolerable to people who despise the constant interruptions to the original’s natural flow of storytelling and gameplay.\\nSomething I have yet to express in my previous reviews of Max Payne is that while I always enjoy replaying them to experience the story I have never really enjoyed how long they are. In fact, one reason why I liked MP2 more than the original was that it was more concise to never overstay its welcome. Having explained my stance on previous games, it should be telling that MP3 only began to wane in its final hours when levels began to feel like padding even though the game is far longer than the previous two combined. This is what I attribute to the game having excellent pacing as well as constant changes to the gameplay through the visual effects of the level-design and playable cutscenes interspersed with the non-interactive cutscenes and the hands-free battles.\\nIt can be understandable why the constant interruption to take way the player’s controls can become irritable to diehards who simply want to play as well as the changes to the weapon system limits. This latter issue is something I believe fixes a reoccurring problem in the past games where certain weapons became worthless over the course of the game by making every weapon viable, and MP3 is a case where having less weapons (two side-arms and one two-handed gun) makes for a better experience. On top of the gameplay benefits, this limit ties into the dynamic cinematic system of using the player’s arsenal during the cutscenes as well as making some of them playable, not including the dynamic bullet cams and thousands of animations on Max, to make the whole experience as smooth as possible whereas the graphic novel cutscenes of old always made the story and gameplay feel separated. As a whole, the approach to do less with the gameplay to create more spectacle is something that is to the game’s credit, which is why when you install the Payne Evolution mod for MP2 the controls from MP3 feel like the refinement the series always needed.\\nOne complaint I will somewhat agree is to the detriment to the gameplay is the gameplay’s adherence to reward more cover-based playstyles than having no cover from the original. As someone who played all three games back-to-back, I could play most of MP3 without having to hug the cover as Max retains his mobility and his bullet-time to reward skill players. (The addition of a second-chance when holding painkillers also is a blessing.) However, there were situations where there was a lack of cover to naturally weave in and out of as well as armored enemies that can only be killed with a lot of ammo to encourage turtling up on walls. This change is something I find harder to accept as the playstyle is mostly doable on hard mode, yet eventually the player will be encouraged to play the safest way to avoid restarting checkpoints too often.\\nNow do I believe all these harmful changes made to the Max Payne legacy were done without respecting the original source material from Remedy Entertainment? No, because if anything Rockstar went to great lengths to respect previous players by giving them a truly mature storyline with a likable character who retains all his lovable qualities as well as respecting the secret ending of Max Payne 2 by nether confirming nor denying that Mona Sax survived. That level of commitment to respect the series’ history is a sign that this game was attempting to do something true to the original while being innovative, and I wish more developers had the cojones to tackle established series with as much risk as Rockstar did to innovate Max Payne for the modern age.\\nAs much as I would like to see Rockstar continue Max Payne’s legacy beyond the surprisingly happy ending after all the hardships he has been through, the finality of MP3 is what makes me enjoy replaying the series as a whole. If Max is left sipping away his days on the beaches of Bahia to move on with his life for once, then I cannot think of a greater send-off to a series than that final shot of Max free from his inner monologues walking off into the sunset.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Brothers in Arms series is my favorite in the WW2 FPS genre, but this is definitely my second favorite. It\\'s essentially the same formula you see in most WW2 shooters, but instead of having linear levels, each mission is a reasonably large map with multiple objectives that you can take on in any order. The game drops you into the map by airplane, and you can parachute to wherever you want to start (there are designated green smoke \"safe zones\" where the enemies don\\'t spawn, but you\\'re generally free to experiment with landing wherever you think would give you the best advantage). You can find a decent amount of standard WW2 guns throughout the levels, and each of them has 3 levels of upgrade attachments that you unlock after getting a certain amount of kills with each one.\\nWith that being said, there\\'s a reason it\\'s only my second favorite. For one thing, the game is really short - it only has 6 missions, which each last somewhere close to an hour each. They\\'re largely unconnected, and for the most part the other soldiers are all just a bunch of faces, with no real narrative or characters to give more purpose to the nazi killing like you might be used to in other shooters in the genre. The game\\'s AI is also pretty severely lacking, and tend to navigate the levels in a way that hints that they weren\\'t really ready to make a game where you aren\\'t on a set path. It\\'s not usually noticeable for the enemies that are spawned into the game when you first begin a mission, but for freshly spawned enemies and allies it can be pretty bad.\\nOverall I\\'d still recommend it, if only because it\\'s so old now that it\\'s only $10, which in my opinion is worth it for a game as fun as this even as short as it is. But if $10 for 6 hours isn\\'t enough for you, it might be better to wait for a sale. Either way, I\\'d recommend it if you like WW2 games.',\n",

The realism in this game is not accurate. I feel like there would be more weapons lying around in real life.  My whole experience with this game amounts to starting up, wandering around, seeing a zombie, now there are 5-10 zombies running at me, running for my life with nothing but a can of beans and whatever stock items I have on me, summoning up the courage to fight and kill a zombie, learning that basic attacks i.e. punching suck in this game, dying. The next play through (6 months later) I decided to play sneakier. So if I saw a zombie I'd just try my best not to pull aggro, and continue searching for some kind of weapon. Welp, that would eventually just lead to dying. My 3rd and final try at the game was the exact same experience as the 2nd, with that I quit, uninstalled for the 3rd time, and never thought about it again until now, when I am writing this review (2 years later).\\nWhat can I say about it, when it has such a high learning curve, no initial thrust into it's environment, and no real goal at hand? I didn't expect a story, or anything of Minecraft proportions, but I did expect to at least shoot a gun or two, or maybe even play with other people. That's one thing I forgot to mention, every time I played, I never ran into anyone on the servers. I saw people online in the servers, but never saw anyone playing in game. Another thing to mention is how bland the world is in this game. It's boring, the houses have nothing going on in them. there is nothing to do at all except die, die, die.\\nI even gave this game a huge chance seeing how it was early access. I see people complaining about how it still is early access even after 3 years. Personally, I don't mind because it makes it feel like it's still 2013, which is nice.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'m very nearly not recommending this, but it gets a pass. If you\\'ve already played Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania (which isn\\'t out yet but reviews are great so far), and you want a Sonic-feeling PC game, then this is a good pick. It\\'s fun and fast, with great art and music.\\nUnfortunately it\\'s far from perfect. The story and voice acting are cheesy and weird and not really in an enjoyable way. I wish the levels were shorter, as you kind of have to commit yourself to a half hour every time you sit down. The cut scenes are quite long, and if the levels were split up a bit like the zones in Sonic games, it might make the cut scenes easier to get through.\\nThe hit boxes sometimes behave strangely, and there\\'s next to no invincibility after you get hit, so getting juggled and losing most of your health is common and not fun.\\nAlso the collectables in the game are completely pointless. To compare, in Sonic the rings are also your health, you drop rings when you get hit, if you collect 100 you get an extra life. In Shovel Knight, a different indie pixel art 2D retro-style platformer, the money you collect is for upgrades and you lose some when you die. In Freedom Planet, you collect crystals. You never lose crystals, and if you collect 200, you gain an extra life. Now in Sonic, if you lose all your lives- that was it- game over. In Shovel Knight, they\\'ve done away with lives and given a well-designed check point system that takes money when you fail and rewards risk-taking. In Freedom Planet, if you run out of lives you gain five more. That\\'s it. There is no penalty whatsoever for losing lives. Meaning lives don\\'t matter, meaning crystals don\\'t matter. Why do the crystals exist? No one knows. What a bafflingly stupid design choice.\\nThe difficulty scaling is also way off in my opinion. The levels are all incredibly easy, since death means nothing the only goal is really to get to the next checkpoint, so health is a minor concern. So the bosses are the real challenge of the game, with the quality of them varying greatly. The first few bosses are quite easy, and then there is a sudden difficulty spike. All of the bosses are manageable until the third phase of the final boss, which suddenly gives no tells and is completely randomized in how to operates. I beat it, but if felt more like I got lucky than anything skill-based.\\nDamn, that is a lot of bad things for a positive review. I\\'m a very negative person. There are a lot of games to play before Freedom Planet, and it\\'s \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" score is unearned in my opinion. But it feels like Sonic 3 when you\\'re speed through the world, and that\\'s what I was looking for. Get it on sale.',\n",

Tanks are customized with the following: wheels/jets/etc, main hull, turret, weapon(s), and supports. It's extremely simple, and adds a bit of thinking since too much weight can slow the tank, and weigh down crawlers. However, one thing truly makes this game stand out:\\nThe free-to-play games usually rely on players making purchases. This does not.\\nWhile some may deeply disagree, hear me out.\\nOn the totally free version, you are not bombed with offers. You are not restricted from important features. Only two items can be purchased, Basic, and Premium. On free, you are limited to 10 purchased parts, and can earn more by leveling up. On basic, you have unlimited parts, and premium gives you access to\\nparts. You can sell unused parts, as well. In all, you can dominate the battlefield without paying for anything. And yes, it is a little difficult to level up, but you can earn at least one gold in any match (parts cost anywhere from 5-15 gold), and sell other parts.\\nThe only real problem I have is that there is no chat filter. Most of the time, everyone's to busy playing to talk, but people will often visit the chat to rage.\\n8.5/10 overall\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This game is, by far, one of my favorites. I've been playing this game for a few years (though my Steam account would say otherwise xD) and have come to love this game very much in doing so. It is a very large game, with tons of other players. You get a set list of servers to play on, and you do get a limit to how many characters you can have on your account.\\nCharacter creation&Basic Character Stuff:\\nThere is a vast horizon of options to choose from for your character's appearance. I have always found anything besides character height, race, and head/face options a bit unnecessary, since most of the time your armor (appearance and/or actual equipment) will cover it. But, it's still fun to give your character that tattoo that nobody will see, right? ;)\\nNames are also an interesting thing in this game, because once you reach a certain level, you can give your character a last name. I can't list too many games off the top of my head that will let you give your character a last name. There are also two different equipment tabs. One of them is the equpiment that you wear for the item bonuses such as stat boosters and whatnot. If you don't have any appearance equipment, the other equipment tab, then this is the gear you'll see. Appearance equipment is also another interesting aspect of this game; tons of players with different combinations of equipment in their appearance slots mean it's hard to find two players that look the same.\\nMounts are another wonderful aspect of this game. With tons of different mounts, there really is almost no limit to going places.\\nGameplay:\\nThe gameplay of this game is rather simple, in all reality. You get a ton of spells that you use, and the amount increases with progression through the game, and go into hotbars. A majority of combat in this game is, in most cases, just clicking of the icons in your hotbar. The animations for your spells aren't too impressive in themselves, unless your graphics are cranked up, however, don't let this deter you.\\nThe story for each character class is fairly different, being that in the end, each character begins on a story to get their epic weapon, the weapon for each class that will become their signature (though often, becomes replaced in-game due to stats not being impressive enough) weapon of choice. Each expansion adds to the story, too, that goes beyond your epic weapon. Even if you aren't paying attention to the stories you get into in too great detail, this game is just fun to play.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Bioshock 2 is viewed as the black sheep of the \"Shock\" franchise, created as a cheap cash-in sequel by a different development team that crafted the first Bioshock.  But beyond the initial impressions from fans and critics lies a very competent game, that in some spots actually outshines the original.\\n-The story is just as good, if not better, than the original.  Most people disliked the story because it didn\\'t add much depth to the mythos of Rapture, but the story in Bioshock 2 is much more personal and is more about the citizens of Rapture than the city itself.\\n-The gameplay is vastly improved.  Plasmids and Guns are duel wielded, making combining them in combat much easier.\\n-Mechanics are streamlined, not simplified.  Gene tonics no longer have a type and can just be equipped, assuming you have the slots.  Hacking is now done in real time on a simplified  mini-game.  Even the research mechanic is reworked to use a video-camera that gives you more research points depending on how well you combo your plasmids/weapons.  There are also new weapons and plasmids that are fun to use and don\\'t feel gimmicky.\\n-The art design is top notch.  The level designers have fun showing what rapture would look like with 10 more years of rust and decay.\\n-More moral decisions beyond \"Save/Kill Little Sister\".  The game also uses your decisions to inform the last act of the game and the ending.\\n-Final \"boss\" fight is much better than the one in the first game.\\n-The first hour of the game stinks. Period.  After you get into the first real level, the game begins to open up and let you start having fun.\\n-Some of the new characters have to be hand waved into existence, especially since they were supposed to be around before the first game but are clearly never mentioned in the first game.\\n-Levels are much more linear and not as large as in the first game. There are few sidepaths, but mostly you\\'ll be running from point A to B without backtracking.\\n-There are a few new enemies but I would have liked more enemy variety.\\n-You can use little sisters to gather Adam, but you have to protect them as they do it.  Most people hated the escort mission from the first game, so it\\'s something to be aware of.   I personally enjoyed this part of the game due to the multitude of alternate amunition that makes setting up traps fun.\\n-It\\'s clear that there were some significant rewrites late in development, some characters introduced at the start of the game are simply left out of the rest of the game\\'s plot.\\n-The FoV is very low and requires ini-rebinding to reset it every time you launch the game.  The problem is going into ironsights also resets the FoV, making you have to press your bound key to reset your FoV every time.\\n-Occasional issues with audio cutting out if there were too many sounds are playing at once.\\n\\nIgnore people saying the game is a cheap cash in: the gameplay is better and arguably so is the story.  Although there are fewer levels than in the original, the game actually took me more hours to beat than the first game: around 14 hours.  It’s also interesting that a lot of the story beats and themes end up being used in Bioshock Infinite (although I’m sure Ken Levine hates to admit it).\\nMinerva\\'s Den is also an excellent add-on to the base game, and lasts around 3 hours.  I\\'d recommend playing through Bioshock 2 on hard mode if you\\'ve played many shooters before, the difficulty curve stays pretty good throughout the entire base game.  Minerva\\'s Den is a bit harder on the same difficulty however, so keep that in mind.',\n",

       "  'text': \"This game was buggy but tons of fun when it first released into Early Release... The nights were filled with danger and DARK forcing players to hudle around Campfires for the 5 or 10 minutes that it was night and talk and get to know each other. There was no World wide chat even for Guilds so you were forced to communicate in person to find out about the wars and adventures down south since we had settled in the north. Because Nights were so dark trips down south felt like massive adventures. You had better hope there was a friendly Guild who had set up shop along your path that you could hangout with for the night. It wasn't uncommon to meet traders traveling around selling their wares and bringing news of some massive Guild Invasion they had just witnessed. Your surrounding Guilds were your community. Guilds watched out for each other and brought word of Raiding Parties that were entering the area. At that point it was time to mobilize your surrounding Guilds and start community patrols. The wars were huge and required knowing the game including the little bugs that you could take advantage of in order to get the upper hand... Some wars even required a little Environmental Terrorism to finally win.\\nThose were the fun days though. With the official release of the game however there is no fun to be had. The charm of the game has been lost. This release brought many changes alot possitive and my guild was really excited when we first got in and started seeing the changes... Then came the warden tree and the small ugly bases it now forces. All Creative freedom the game once had has now been elimenated in it's place boxes or diamonds are forced on everyone. That would have been ok if you got a decent number of additional walls with each Tree upgrade. However your stuck with 5 additional walls with each upgrade. The Upgrades are time consuming and expensive even for the largest of guilds. Taking days just to find the materials you need and then the 10 Silver for the first upgrade. All this work for 5 additional walls which isn't even to construct an airlock on your base. Base defenses aren't much better... You get 2 Watch Towers with the intial Warden Tree and then an additional Watch tower with every upgrade. Won't do much against a full on assault...\\nAs much as I love this game and have had so much fun in it prior to this release I can't possible recommend this game in the condition it's currently in. Really sucks because this was the developer's final chance to have this game succeed. RIP Tree of Life! It's been fun!\",\n",

I get the nostalgia aspect, but the odd reality is that I cherish the memory of playing those old school games more than I actually enjoy playing them today. When I do play them, it's an immediate reminder of where games are today and how far along games have come and why products have advanced the way they have. While old school games were considered technically superior in their time, they are considered technically inferior today. In fact, most games of yesteryear made the most of the technology available to them. So designing a technically inferior product today, on purpose, is not that impressive to me.\\nMany great old school games are classified as abandonware and the ROMs and emulation software can be easily found to play them for whatever gaming system you cherished the most. Find them, play them, and try to enjoy them the same way you did 30 years ago. I've tried, but it's not the same.

       "  'text': 'I played this game when it was originally released back in 2001. I got Red Faction (RF) in a bundle years ago, but haven\\'t played it since way back then. Now that it\\'s 2017 I decided to play through it again and see if it held up to the nostalgia I once had. Unfortunately it did not.\\nPlease note: Screenshots in above game description do not represent actual in-game screens. These have been massively doctored. Also game was played with PureFaction a mod that allows you to play in widescreen. That\\'s why my playtime is so low. Actual playtime is probably closer to 8 or 9 hours and that completed the sp campaign.\\nOn to the review:\\nRed Faction is a game that came out in the wake of Half-Life. It breaths Half-Life. In fact, it almost feels like a mod more than an original game. Many of the weapons are taken from HL. Troops and scientist look eerily similar. There is a tram portion. There are ducts to move around in. There are big round tunnels with fans on the end. Halfway through the game they mention the soldiers are killing all the scientists.\\nAll these things were not a thing until HL which came out only 2 or 3 years prior to RF. This was something I did not even notice playing back in \\'01, but now it\\'s almost too obvious. Not to say a HL clone makes a game bad. It\\'s just shows it\\'s age and lack of creativity.\\nRF biggest selling point was that everything in the game was to be destructible. Unfortunately it\\'s not. Only some dirt is destructible, but not all dirt. I remembered how awesome it was to destroy a wall and dig a tunnel. Somehow that memory is skewed. You are not given a pickaxe or anything to dig with. You have explosives in minimal quantity. Destructible pieces are not highlighted. Sometimes you can break through stuff, but really the mechanic was not used more than once or twice in the game. You can blow up certain walls to find extra armor or ammo, but those times are limited and usually there\\'s 2 ways into said, \"secret,\" areas so you didn\\'t even need to blast anything anyway.\\nHowever, the above issues are just minor. Who really cares if it\\'s a HL clone or its biggest selling point was a farce as long as the game is fun right? Unfortunately... it\\'s not... and I hate to say that because I remember really having fun with this game 16 years ago. But by today\\'s standards, the game does not hold up very well. It\\'s not one that stood the test of time to be sure.\\nWeapon reloads are soooo sloooowwwww! It can take irl 5 to 15 seconds to reload and don\\'t expect to switch once the animation starts. Oh no! You just have to break from combat and take bullets or find cover. Melee is op for mobs and broken for you. There\\'s a baton in the game. When you select it there is a 10 second readying weapon animation that you have to endure before you can use it. Why would you ever ready melee that needs 10 sec before you can use it?!? However, the mobs run right at you and hit constantly until you kill them. They run faster than you; so you can\\'t try to outrun. Imagine going through a 15 sec reload animation, while attempting to kite, but getting non-stop meleed the entire time.\\nGuns on the other hand are an entirely different level of frustration. There is no mouse smoothing; so I personally had jittery aim. It\\'s not a problem in other games, but it could be something to do with my mouse: Logitech G502. I\\'ll give them that. But the mobs dart back and forth so quickly you can\\'t ever get a good shot. I wasted more ammo on walls than enemies. Also, enemies are bullet sponges, taking multiple shots before dying. It\\'s massively frustrating to constantly miss shots because of enemies darting around and a jittery mouse. On the other hand, this could have something to do with PureFaction, the mod I used to play this game in 1080p. I don\\'t remember it being so difficult to shot people, then again 2001 was a different time for games.\\nThe cut scenes in this game should be turned into memes. It\\'s beyond campy. It turns hilarious because it\\'s so bad. It\\'s like watching Trolls 2 for the first time all over again. This game is worth a play through just to watch the cut scenes I swear!\\nBut overall this game just fails in everything. It fails in destructible environments (YOU HAD ONE JOB) it fails at a decent story, and it fails at smooth \\'n fun FPS action. I definitely do not recommend.',\n",

       "  'text': 'This game is now officially my \"biggest positive surprise of 2016\" (and yes, I know it\\'s older than that, but that\\'s when I played it, so gimme a break!)\\nPremise: I freakin\\' loved Lost Planet 2 for it\\'s co-op gameplay and silly, wacky action nonsense. It was the best sort of japanese couch co-op gameplay I can imagine. Thus, when I heard that LP3 was single player only, I was really, really sceptical of the game and put off playing it for a long time.\\nI was wrong to do so.\\nWhile LP3 does not tickle the same nerves as LP2 did, it\\'s a damn fine game! The story, full of interesting and well written characters, with a diverse cast of high quality voice actors that can really drive home the mentality of each person, was surprisingly well in line with that of the past games. Heck, a couple of times I found myself really sympathizing with some of the characters, which is rare for me.\\nAs for the gameplay, LP3 is a three-prong affair. You have small segments of just walking around, listening to people, upgrading yourself (though many upgrades felt like fairly pointless fluff to be honest, sort of tacked on to check some boxes, but it\\'s not really off-putting). Then there\\'s the parts, about half of the game, where you run about, gunning down Akrid (the insectoid enemies of the game) and uncovering the rest of the game\\'s story.\\nThen there\\'s the RIG, your very own mech that you get to stomp around in. It\\'s clunky, it\\'s slow, but it\\'s got personality to it. You get to listen to some surprisingly fitting tunes, get a new perspective on your surroundings and the walker even acts as a sort of base of operations when fighting enemies, providing you with your minimap and other info.\\nHowever, this mechanic, like a few others (such as the upgrading) isn\\'t really used all that much in the actual gameplay, for which I have to dock some points. Another thing I have to dock points for is the simplicity of most of the combat. The enemy patters are quickly learned and once this is done, many of the fights that are intended to be difficult turn into grenade-spamming, dodge-rolling repetition. Fortunately this also means you can breeze through most fights quite quickly once this stage sets in.\\nVisually speaking the game is a bog stanrad Unreal 3 -affair with some uncommonly good face capture in it. It\\'s pretty, and the visual style of the game is cool for the most part. Especially the RIG is a damn cool machine, and I have to also give a few bonus points for keeping the style well in line with the past games as well!\\nIn the end, with a solid story, gorgeous vistas, and mostly entertaining gameplay, I found myself positively surprised and actually quite hooked on LP3. With that, I give it a warm recommendation and a thumbs up.\\nPlaytime: 10+ hours (single playthrough)\\nRatings (1-10)\\nVisual: 8\\nAudio: 9\\nStory: 8\\nGameplay: 7\\nOverall: 9',\n",

Those who are looking at reviews of all 3 games, my recommendation is to get 1 and 3 and skip 2. Anyways on with the review. The level design and story pacing is good. The lore is connected to the 1st game so if you have played it and enjoyed learning the lore, a lot of the knowledge crosses over and makes 3 even more enjoyable from a lore standpoint. Each fight was designed well except for a couple but that didnt take away from the overall game. (no more body flinging ragdoll, i really miss that) combat is spot on like always, though PvP could use some changes because of the way connection to hosts/servers work. A highly recommended game for those who are avid soul game players and those who like a challange just like the other soul games. And also recommended to those looking to get into the souls series though i would suggest starting out on the 1st game if you care about lore.\",\n",

The enemies are all nazi's so if you are jewish you should really get your money's worth out of this. The nazi mind controlled dogs are wicked and the big♥♥♥♥♥nazi robot death machines are awesome. You can sneak up behind guys and knife kill them or blow your way through them with rifles, shotguns, and so on, even a sweet version of the rail gun. The level design is great: levels are a lot of fun to navigate and fight your way through. However once you've played the game there isn't much reason to play through again because it is what it is. But the one trip you take is a really fun ride. I am enjoying cranking up my 5.1 surround system and mowing down enemies like a whirlwind of pain. The game is made really well despite some slight performance issues. I have to turn off in-game vsync because it causes horrible stuttering and force it through nvidia control panel then the game runs smooth.\\nThe graphics are great and the sound is very good. The music is fitting and the game flows well in terms of both gameplay and story. The game is completely badass in every way. Dual wielding assault rifles and blowing away everything in sight never gets old.\\nOverall 8/10\",\n",

You're forced to use whatever equipment they give you. You're also given currency to buy consumerable equipment if you're having a rough time. The levels are small and can take a about 10 minutes at most to beat each one.\\nThe bad parts? Unfortunately, it doesn't feel like Halo. This is Halo lite. Enemies are dumb, and the maps are incredibly tiny. (Some maps are less than 3-4 screens!) It doesn't feel epic like the FPS Halo games.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"This game reminded me of playing smash bros on my wii when I was little, yea i know I didnt play the original smash bros, but I still loved the game. I like this game better though, in my perspective I am not a child anymore and feel like all nintendo games are for children, lol. This game is like the adult game of smash bros, or a 2D version with its own cool characters, combos, and weapons.\\nI discovered this game by seeing a friend play it and decided to download it and give it a try. I wasn't hooked onto this game right off the bat, but later on I got another friend to download it and we started playing 2v2 ranked and just had an absolute blast.\\nPROS:\\n- Smash Bros CLONE ON PC!!!!\\n- NON-TOXIC COMMUNITY at the moment because the game's community is still small and growing\\n- MATCHES ARE FAST if you verse button smashing noobs, but is still pretty quick like sub 5 min\\n- GAME IS FREAKIN FREE\\n- YOU CAN PURCHASE all the characters by just getting in game coins\\n- CUSTOM ROOMS to test stuff or just fight with randoms or friends\\n- PRACTICE modes to just get better and practice combos\\nCONS:\\n- Can only purchase the GOOD looking skins which pretty much include all the skins with real life money. NOT IN GAME GOLD.\\n- A lot of the characters moves  are similar, with an exception to some, but can have different graphical animations to go along with them. For example the katar dives, hammer down smash.\\n- There is not much to do with all your gold if you already have all the characters, unless you wait for a holiday event (the current holiday summer event is not really that good all you can really buy is orange skins for all the characters , not a lot of creativity) and all the cool stuff is payed with real life money.\\nI really enjoy this game and understand that it needs money to improve, I purchased the character pack instead of buying them with in game gold, because I wanted to support this free game. Mainly because it is one of the rare enjoyable free games. Other than that I do not feel an obligation to buy skins or in-game items because it's just not worth it to purchase a digital item which has no real life value, that is my opinion. Therefore, I would say that my major con is the lack of cool or unique items to purchase in-game with gold coins. My pro's are the FANTASTIC community and the competitivness that I look for in games. If I would rate this out of 10 I would give it a 7.9/10 because it is a good game but is not on its prime level in popularity as well as still being on the way to perfection. Anyway, GO GET THIS GAME CUZ IT'S FREE AND FUN.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Shadow Warrior Classic Redux is a 2013 remaster or update of an original Shadow Warrior game that came out in 1997, used Build engine and was made by 3D Realms. Or \"Lo Wang is Shadow Warrior\" if we are to belive what cover of a box said. It\\'s an old-school FPS game and can be descriped as eastern bro of Duke Nukem 3D.\\nClassic Redux also includes original DOS version, as well as all two released expansion packs, which are freeware anyway. There is no multiplayer from original. Original had competetive (DM) and cooperative modes, though it uses service which isn\\'t there anymore, so you can\\'t use original. Or at least as far as I am aware.\\nAs for technical side, there are occasional crashes. They can happen randomly, but mostly when I rushed with katana and would get blown up. Anyway, save often!\\nA more serious issue with this release got to be circular ground mines in Twin Dragon expansion. In original they would lay on ground, emitting a beeping sound like sticky bombs. When you come close to them, they will first rise into ground and then explode hard after few seconds, so you have to get into range to activate it and then run away. Sadly, mines are glitched in Classic Redux, they are actually sank into ground, so you can\\'t see them, but painful explosion still happens over ground. If you hear bomb beeping nearby - save and get ready to do some blind work.\\nThe setting is awesome, while plot is non-existant. You are Lo Wang, an asian pervy old fart, who is Shadow Warrior by the way. Which makes you think that he is a stealth master, but in reality he likes nuclear weapons. He worked for Master Zilla as a bodyguard, until Lo finds out that Zilla\\'s corporations goes as low as using demons to do dirty work, and his code of honor does not approve that. Zilla doesn\\'t want some Wang this way either.\\nSo you go around in either villages, temples or even cities and wreck mutants and monsters up. While meeting anime girls randomly. Hm, just like tentacled womans in Duke Nukem 3D, but most of them think that Lo Wang should just go away. They should have released a collab FPS title so we could get tentacled anime babes.\\nThe game is a lot like Duke Nukem, though it doesn\\'t have as much of city levels. But they are still gimmicky and overdetailed. Like, you can play Panchinko machines. Kinda. Or punch training equpment to regenerate your health without limit like a Shadow Casual. One liners are still funny, though \"ancient Chinese secret\" pops up too much. There are more cool stuff in it too, like more useful items that include \"grenades\", though only Gas one is for throwing. Some weapons have few modes which you can change with alt-fire. You can even use occasional vehicle, even though they are rare and kinda suck and have horrible collision.\\nActually, when I played this last time seriously times ago, I didn\\'t like it so much. It wasn\\'t fun, it seemed like game had too much punishing hitscan. Now I beat this game and had no issue for some reason, it was enjoyable a lot. Strange. Maybe that\\'s because before that I played on Hard (3th skill), while now I played on Normal (2nd skill), maybe the gap between these two is huge. Then again, hard hitscan enemies are always awful idea. Or maybe the mouselook and WASD of Classic Redux made it easier than doing it on keyboard-only of original DOS. Or maybe I just learned that some 90s FPS aren\\'t as awesome as Doom and you have to often retreat and use indirect ways to fight, instead of circle-strafing into every encounter. And if you ever meet Shadow ninja, then you are supposed to immeditly retreat, unless you want to get one-hit-killed.\\nI mean, you got a Grenade Launcher in this game. In other FPS it\\'s like Rocket Launcher but worse, with arcing grenades. You usually can hit things around corner only if you measure accurately and usually you are just a fool when you can just shoot into face. Not in Shadow Warrior! This bloody thing here has a freaking nuclear radius of explosions. What it means is that it\\'s actually useful to clean rooms around corners, while you don\\'t want to use it to fight face-to-face, as it\\'s weaker than rocket and easily hits you too. Actually, it might be way too good, ammo could be less common.\\nI really suggest you to check out Steam Guide of Quick Tips by Joseph Hicks, it really is a good one.\\nAnd yea, there are also some strange balance and choices, like railgun doesn\\'t have much use and it annoyes me that it shoots misaligned compared to crosshair. Katana is a fun melee weapon that at least instakills most common ninjas. You still look like a fool when swinging it over tougher enemies. Hmmmm, this game would have been better if it had cheesy colorful human ninjas from American stuff instead of mutant-ninjas.\\nAs for Classic Redux, well, this update comes with some cool stuff, mostly modern controls, widescreen support, renderer and Steam Integration so you can just use Steam Workshop! If you don\\'t like it, DOSBox-supported original is also included.\\nIt has a bunch of interesting stuff done in it. Main theme was remixed, though I prefer original. Weapon graphics were tweaked a bit so it doesn\\'t look weird on widescreen, like katana was made longer by looping parts of it. It sure looks better!\\nYou can even change if you want shurikens or darts graphics for the second weapon you have. That\\'s because the British version of original game was censored and had darts instead. I would say that darts make more sense in this case as the weapon feels very weak. Well, aside from part where they ricochet off walls. Don\\'t tell me about \"it\\'s not bad weapon as you can recover them off walls\", the game has problems with vertically when it comes to \"use\" action, so it\\'s weird and hard to get them all back.\\nSadly, some cheats don\\'t work. Mostly level select one. Aw.\\nAs you expect, like all full versions of a game, it comes with two episodes: Shareware episode \"Enter The Wang\" made of 4 levels and Full-Game-only \"Code of Honor\" made of around 18 levels. Shareware episodes uses full version\\'s CD Music instead of MIDI, but the only thing you miss is that one track sounded like nothing in registered version. Heh, you can notice how those Shareware levels were much better than Registered ones. Some probably were dissapoint after purchasing game. First half of Code of Honor isn\\'t particulary hot.\\nIt also comes with both expansion pack. Both were released for free due to being kinda considered abandoned by that time. Or just too late for party. They were being developed by other companies and publisher didn\\'t feel like investing more, or something.\\nTwin Dragon was released in 1997. It kinda had half good levels like Lo Wang\\'s house and fish village, and half of generic levels, like those sewer mazes. Some guess that it wasn\\'t complete release, as there is no new soundtrack like promised. Also, final boss, who is reskin, spamming \"there can be only one\".\\nWanton Destruction was found in 2005. It\\'s really all good stuff, it even reskinned most enemies into humans. Recommended, mhm.\\nThey say that they found materials of Deadly Kiss, the third expansion out of three, that was considered being lost. Maybe we will get it some day.\\nAnd heck, at least this game has awesome boss fight music, unlike Duke Nukem 3D who is a sissy. And Lo Want no sissy! Most of arcade or old gamers know that this is the most important element of any game.\\nIn the end, outside of some glitches which aren\\'t ruining whole game, it\\'s a pretty good redux of a decent game. Pretty fun. At least on Normal, since it abuses hitscan a bit too much at times for 90s shooter. Even though it didn\\'t bring multiplayer, but these are single-player focused games after all, multiplayer was just for fooling around. Big levels full of secrets ahead!',\n",

It is certainly a twist from your usual VN.\\nThe art and music were also nice and created a strong atmosphere within the game play.

       "  'text': 'Atom Zombie Smasher is a super little indie strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take on the guise of a commander holding back the zombie hordes from overruning your city.\\nIt works on two levels; first is the strategy where a map of the city districts is where you see the progress of zombie infestations and plan your next mission.  You can choose which military assets you take with you from: infantry, snipers, mines, demolitions, barricades, gas attracting teams or artillery.  Once you initiate the mission, the game changes to a tactical sub-game where you place your units on the map to best protect the civilians you are trying to extract from the map, while avoiding collateral damage.  To many dead civilians and you fail.\\nThere are a number of tactical elements that affect each mission type such as: map layout, dangerous area which can explode if you are not careful, more or less time-limit & available/unavailable units.\\nYou win if you extract a minimum number of civilians or your units are able to destroy the encroaching zed hordes.  However if you do not clear the map of zeds before nightfall more zeds arrive to swarm the map.  Successful missions reward you with points that go towards an overall victory target.  Units also receive XP to increase their unique zed destroying abilities and they can level up to increase those abilites to make them more clincial.\\nThe zeds then receive strategic points allocated to some city district (1-4) which determines the strength of the zombie hordes and the difficulty of initiating a mission there.  This continues until you reach the campaign victory target.\\nThough gameplay is fairly repetitive the addition of custom campaign options make the strategy and tactical aspects that much more varied.  Scientists can be found wondering the city area and can be rescued.  Each one can then be \"spent\" to acquire research upgrades towards 8 specific areas of interest including: faster xp gains for units, faster strategic weapons, resilient scientist, more destructive weapons etc).  You can have access to strategic and tactical weapons that can clear zeds from an entire district thus reseting the danger level there.  Just be aware of the monster-zeds! lol\\nFor me this was a surprise gem of a game.  While graphics are just basic sprites, it really can grab you if you let it.  It one of the most intelligently designed games Ive ever played and almost perfectly balanced.  While the musical score and audio is fairly basic, they do a wonderful job of immersing you in unfolding events.  Best of all its a very polished game.   Even if some Mac users are having problems with playing it.\\nIf you are after a basic but enjoyable zombie apocalypse survival simulator then you should pick up a copy when the price is right for you!',\n",
